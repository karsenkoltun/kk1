  content: `A home inspection in Kelowna isn't the same as one in Toronto or Vancouver. The Okanagan has its own set of quirks, risks, and red flags that a thorough home inspection checklist needs to account for. From elevated radon gas levels hiding in basements to wildfire exposure on hillside properties, the things that can bite you here are specific to this valley and the way homes have been built in it over the decades.

Whether you're buying a 1980s rancher in Rutland, a newer build in Black Mountain, or an acreage in South East Kelowna, understanding what to look for during a home inspection in BC will save you from expensive surprises after you get the keys. This isn't about scaring you out of a purchase. It's about walking in with your eyes open.

## How a Home Inspection Works (And What It Costs in Kelowna)

A standard home inspection is a visual, non-invasive examination of a property's major systems and structures. The inspector checks the roof, foundation, electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, insulation, windows, doors, and appliances, then documents everything in a detailed report with photos.

In the Okanagan, **a typical home inspection runs between $400 and $650** depending on the size and age of the property. Condos sit at the lower end. Homes over 4,500 square feet or estate properties can push past $1,000. The inspection itself takes roughly three to four hours for an average 2,500 square foot house, though older Okanagan homes sometimes need extra time.

A home inspector doesn't pass or fail a property. There's no grade. What you get is a clear picture of the home's current condition, deficiencies, safety concerns, and maintenance recommendations. That information becomes your leverage for negotiating repairs, adjusting your offer price, or walking away entirely.

Most inspectors recommend attending near the end for a walkthrough summary. It's a chance to see issues firsthand and ask questions while standing right in front of the problem.

## Radon Gas: The Invisible Risk in Okanagan Homes

If there's one thing that separates a home inspection in Kelowna from most other Canadian cities, it's radon. The entire Okanagan Valley sits on geological conditions that produce elevated levels of radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive gas released when uranium breaks down in soil and rock. You can't see it, smell it, or taste it. But it seeps into homes through any opening that contacts the ground and accumulates in basements and lower levels.

The numbers are concerning. According to the BC Lung Foundation's community testing program, **23% of homes tested in Kelowna exceeded Health Canada's guideline of 200 Bq/m\u00B3**. In West Kelowna, that number jumped to 36%. Lake Country hit 52%. Peachland was at 51%. A separate analysis found that 57% of tested buildings in the Central Okanagan exceeded the World Health Organization's more conservative guideline, with Glenmore at 57%, the Mission at 55%, and Rutland at 47%.

Radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers, and Health Canada estimates roughly 3,300 lung cancer deaths annually are linked to residential radon exposure.

**Standard home inspections don't include radon testing.** You'll need to request it as an add-on or hire a separate radon testing professional. Short-term tests (two to seven days) give a quick snapshot and are common during real estate transactions. Long-term tests (90+ days) provide a more accurate seasonal average and are what Health Canada recommends for homeowners assessing ongoing risk. Test kits are available through the BC Lung Foundation for about $50, and professional testing services operate throughout the Okanagan.

If levels come back high, mitigation is straightforward. A sub-slab depressurization system, which draws radon from beneath the home and vents it outside, typically costs between **$2,000 and $4,000** installed by a C-NRPP certified professional. Many newer homes have radon rough-ins already built into the foundation, but the BC building code doesn't require builders to install the active fan system that turns it into a functioning mitigation setup. So even if a home is brand new, don't assume it's radon-free.

## Wildfire Risk and FireSmart Readiness on Okanagan Properties

The 2023 McDougall Creek wildfire made wildfire risk impossible to ignore for anyone buying property in the Kelowna area. That fire damaged or destroyed 303 structures. A post-fire analysis found clear patterns in which homes survived and which didn't, and the findings line up with what you should be examining during an inspection.

Kelowna scored a **9.2 out of 10 on the wildfire fire severity rating for 2025**, up from 8.6 the previous year. If you're buying a home near the wildland-urban interface, which includes large portions of Upper Mission, Black Mountain, McKinley Beach, Kettle Valley, and much of West Kelowna and Lake Country, wildfire readiness should be core to your home inspection tips and due diligence.

Here's what to examine or ask about:

- **Roofing material.** According to FireSmart BC, a home with a fire-resistant roof and a maintained FireSmart zone within 10 metres is up to 90% more likely to survive a wildfire. Cedar shake roofs are a major vulnerability. Look for Class A rated roofing like asphalt shingles, metal, or concrete tile.
- **Vegetation within 10 metres.** The post-fire report on the 2023 Okanagan fires found that damaged homes commonly had coniferous trees like cedars and junipers within 10 metres of the structure. Dead vegetation, pine needles in gutters, and firewood stacked against the house all increase risk.
- **Siding and deck materials.** Combustible siding (wood or vinyl) and wooden decks create ignition points for flying embers. Homes that survived the 2023 fires were more likely to have non-combustible or fire-resistant exteriors.
- **Slope.** Properties on steep slopes face increased fire intensity as flames travel uphill faster. This is common in Upper Mission, parts of Southeast Kelowna, and hillside properties throughout West Kelowna.

The Regional District of Central Okanagan offers free FireSmart property assessments for eligible homes, and the City of Kelowna runs an annual Community Chipping Program to help homeowners remove hazardous vegetation. A FireSmart certification can also help with insurance, as some participating providers offer incentives or discounts for certified homes.

## Foundation, Structure, and the Okanagan's Tricky Soils

Foundation issues don't get the same headlines as wildfires and radon, but they're a real concern in the Okanagan. The valley's geology is a patchwork of glacial deposits, including pockets of clay-heavy soils, sandy soils, and glacial silts, each affecting foundation performance differently.

**Clay soils** are the biggest concern. Clay absorbs water and swells when wet, then shrinks when dry. That constant expansion and contraction cycle puts pressure on foundation walls and can lead to cracking, uneven settling, and bowed basement walls. In the Okanagan's climate, with wet springs and dry summers, this seasonal shift is pronounced. Homes built on clay-heavy soils are more prone to differential settlement, where one part of the foundation sinks more than another, throwing floors out of level and cracking walls.

During a home inspection, watch for these structural warning signs:

- **Stair-step cracks in brick or concrete block foundations.** Small hairline cracks are common and usually cosmetic. Wider, horizontal, or stair-step patterns signal movement.
- **Doors and windows that stick or won't close properly.** This can indicate the frame has shifted due to foundation movement.
- **Uneven or sloping floors.** Bring a marble if you want a low-tech test.
- **Gaps between the chimney or porch and the main house.** Even small separations suggest differential settling.
- **Water damage or efflorescence (white mineral deposits) on basement walls.** This points to moisture intrusion, which worsens clay-related problems.

Your inspector should also assess the grading and drainage around the home. Water pooling near the foundation or downspouts dumping right at the base of the house accelerates soil-related issues. Proper grading that directs water away from the foundation is one of the simplest and most cost-effective preventative measures.

## Plumbing Red Flags: Poly B Piping and Aging Systems

If you're looking at a home in Kelowna built between roughly 1978 and 1995, there's a strong chance it contains **polybutylene (Poly B) plumbing**. This grey, flexible plastic piping was installed in an estimated 200,000 homes across British Columbia, and Kelowna has entire neighbourhoods where it's the standard.

Poly B was banned from the National Plumbing Code in 1997 and officially removed from the list of acceptable materials in 2005. The problem is that chlorine and other disinfectants in municipal water cause the pipe to deteriorate from the inside out. It can look perfectly fine externally while flaking apart internally. When it fails, it fails suddenly, often resulting in flooding and serious water damage.

**Most insurance companies in BC will either charge higher premiums, increase your deductible, or deny coverage outright** if the home has Poly B plumbing. This is a significant financial consideration that goes beyond the inspection itself.

You can identify Poly B by its grey colour (sometimes blue or black) and the marking "PB2110" printed on the pipe. Check near the hot water tank, in the utility room ceiling, under kitchen sinks, and in any unfinished basement or crawlspace areas. If you find it, budget for a full repipe to PEX or copper. A whole-home repipe typically costs between **$6,000 and $18,000** depending on the size and complexity of the home.

Beyond Poly B, older Okanagan homes may also have galvanized steel pipes, which corrode internally and restrict water flow over time, or aging hot water tanks past their eight to twelve year lifespan. Your inspector should note pipe materials and flag any visible corrosion, water stains, or low flow situations.

## Electrical Systems: What Your Inspector Should Flag

Electrical issues in Okanagan homes tend to follow predictable patterns based on when the house was built. Here's what to look for during a home inspection based on the property's age:

**Pre-1950s homes** may still have knob-and-tube wiring. Most insurance companies and mortgage lenders consider it a dealbreaker. Upgrading means a full rewire, which can run **$10,000 to $30,000 or more**.

**1960s and 1970s homes** often have aluminum branch wiring, which is prone to overheating at connections. It requires specific outlets, switches, and connection methods. Your inspector should note its presence and recommend an electrical safety review.

**Across all ages**, watch for frequent breaker trips, warm or dimming lights, buzzing at the panel, mixed two-prong and three-prong outlets, and scorched receptacles. Panel capacity matters too. Older homes with 60 or 100 amp service may struggle with modern demands, especially if you're adding a heat pump, EV charger, or hot tub. Upgrading to 200 amp service typically costs **$3,000 to $8,000**.

Your inspector should also check for GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) protection in bathrooms, kitchens, garages, and outdoor outlets. Modern code requires it, but many older homes haven't been updated.

## Septic vs. Sewer: A Critical Question for Rural Okanagan Properties

If you're buying outside of Kelowna's urban core, particularly in areas like South East Kelowna, parts of Lake Country, rural West Kelowna, or the outskirts of Peachland, the property may be on a **septic system rather than municipal sewer**. This isn't a problem in itself, but it adds a layer of maintenance responsibility and cost that a lot of buyers, especially those coming from cities like Vancouver, aren't expecting.

A septic system treats wastewater on-site using a tank and drain field. When properly maintained, they're effective and environmentally sound. When neglected, they fail, and a septic failure is exactly as unpleasant and expensive as it sounds. The Regional District of Central Okanagan recommends pumping and inspecting septic tanks every three to five years. Signs of trouble include slow drains, sewage odours in the yard, unusually lush grass over the drain field, and sewage surfacing on the lawn.

**A standard home inspection does not typically include a full septic evaluation.** If the property is on septic, hire a specialized septic inspector to assess the tank condition, check drainage, and confirm the system is sized for the home. A failed or undersized system can cost tens of thousands to replace.

It's also worth checking with the City of Kelowna's Sewer Connection Area Program. The city has been actively expanding sewer infrastructure, and some properties currently on septic will have the option to connect to municipal sewer in the coming years. Converting increases property value, eliminates septic failure risk, and protects water quality in Okanagan Lake.

## Don't Skip the Inspection: How to Protect Your Investment

A home inspection in the Okanagan isn't a box to check off your to-do list. It's the single best tool you have to understand what you're actually buying. The $500 to $700 you'll spend on an inspection and add-on tests is trivial compared to the cost of a Poly B repipe, foundation repairs, or a full electrical rewire.

For Okanagan homes specifically, consider adding these to your standard home inspection checklist:

- **Radon testing** (especially for homes with basements or slab-on-grade construction)
- **Septic system evaluation** (for any property not on municipal sewer)
- **FireSmart assessment** (for properties near the wildland-urban interface)
- **Specialized plumbing review** (if Poly B or galvanized piping is identified)

A good inspector won't just hand you a list of problems. They'll help you understand the severity, the urgency, and the likely cost of addressing each issue. That puts you in a position to negotiate intelligently, budget for repairs, or decide a particular property isn't the right fit.`,
