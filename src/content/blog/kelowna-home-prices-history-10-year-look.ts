Whether you're trying to figure out if you missed the boat or wondering if the best buying window is right now, understanding where prices have actually been gives you a massive advantage over anyone just guessing.

The Central Okanagan's housing market doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's been shaped by population booms, government policy changes, once-in-a-generation interest rate swings, and a global pandemic that rewired where Canadians want to live. Let's walk through the last decade, year by year, and look at what actually happened to Kelowna property values and where things might be headed next.

## 2016 to 2018: The First Big Run-Up in Kelowna Real Estate Prices Over Time

A decade ago, Kelowna was still flying under the radar compared to Vancouver. In 2016, the average single-family home in the Central Okanagan hit around $550,000, which felt expensive at the time but looks like a bargain from where we sit now. The market was firmly in seller's territory, and prices were climbing month over month.

<!-- STATS -->

Between 2013 and 2018, detached homes in the Central Okanagan rose roughly 56%, townhouses climbed 61%, and condos gained about 49%, according to data compiled by Coldwell Banker Horizon Realty. This wasn't being driven by foreign money, either. The BC government expanded its foreign buyer tax to the Central Okanagan in 2018, but foreign buyer activity in Kelowna was already below 3% by that point. Local demand, interprovincial migration, and a growing retiree population were doing the heavy lifting.

By mid-2018, the average single-family home had surged past $780,000. But the party didn't last. The provincial government introduced a speculation tax targeting Kelowna and other BC cities, and Ottawa tightened mortgage qualification rules through the B-20 stress test. Combined with rising interest rates, these changes hit the market hard. By August 2018, the average selling price had dropped to $687,400, a 12% plunge in a single month from the July peak of $782,400, according to the Okanagan Mainline Real Estate Board. It was a reminder that what goes up fast can come down fast, too.

The year 2019 brought stability. Prices leveled off, with the average single-detached home sitting around $779,000 according to the Regional District of Central Okanagan's housing assessment. It was a quieter market, and for many, it felt like prices had found a ceiling. They hadn't.

## The COVID Boom: How a Pandemic Reshaped Kelowna Property Values

Nobody saw 2020 coming. When COVID-19 first hit in March, real estate transactions froze along with everything else. But by summer, something unexpected happened. Canadians who could suddenly work from anywhere started asking themselves a simple question: why live in a cramped Vancouver condo when you could have a house with a yard in the Okanagan?

**Kelowna became ground zero for the remote work migration.** The numbers tell the story clearly. Single-family home prices in the Central Okanagan went from an average of $858,741 in 2020 to $1,050,667 in 2021, a jump of 22.3% in a single year, according to RE/MAX Canada's housing outlook report. Townhomes weren't far behind at 18.8% growth, and condos surged 18.3%.

The benchmark price for a single-family home in the Central Okanagan was $776,300 in February 2021, already up 17.5% year over year. By August 2021, that benchmark had rocketed to $961,800. And by the end of 2021, it had crossed the $1 million threshold for the first time. To put that in perspective, Vancouver hit $1 million for average single-family homes back in March 2010. It took Kelowna just over a decade to reach the same milestone.

The 2021 census confirmed what the real estate data was suggesting. The Kelowna census metropolitan area had grown to 222,162 people, up 14% from 194,892 in 2016. That growth rate made Kelowna the fastest-growing metropolitan area in all of Canada. Millennials entering their peak home-buying years and baby boomers looking for lifestyle-rich retirement destinations were both flooding into the Okanagan simultaneously.

Inventory couldn't keep up. Active listings plummeted, bidding wars became the norm, and homes were selling in days rather than weeks. It was a frenzy, and it pushed the **Kelowna housing price chart** to heights nobody had predicted.

## 2022: The Peak, Then the Correction

The first few months of 2022 felt like a continuation of 2021's runaway market. In March 2022, the benchmark price for a single-family home in the Central Okanagan hit $1,129,000, a staggering 34% increase from March 2021's $829,000, according to the Association of Interior Realtors. April pushed even higher, with some sources citing a benchmark of $1,131,800 as the all-time peak.

Then the Bank of Canada stepped in.

After holding the overnight rate at a historic low of 0.25% throughout the pandemic, the central bank began its most aggressive tightening cycle in decades. Rate hikes started in March 2022 and continued relentlessly, eventually pushing the policy rate to 5% by mid-2023. Every increase meant higher mortgage payments, tighter qualification requirements, and fewer buyers who could afford to enter the market.

The impact on Kelowna was swift. By June 2022, the single-family benchmark had dropped to $1,112,400, marking the first back-to-back monthly decline in nearly four years. Inventory started climbing as well, with 1,046 single-family homes on the market in June compared to just 267 in January. The seller's market that had defined the previous two years evaporated almost overnight.

For homeowners who had purchased near the peak, particularly those who had stretched their budgets or taken on variable-rate mortgages, the correction felt painful. For prospective buyers who'd been priced out during the frenzy, it was the first real opportunity to breathe.

## 2023 and 2024: Finding the Floor for Kelowna Home Prices

The correction continued into 2023, but the freefall slowed. The benchmark price for single-family homes in the Central Okanagan settled around $1,009,100 by February 2023, and held relatively steady through the year. By July 2023, the benchmark was $1,063,700, essentially flat compared to July 2022, according to the Association of Interior Realtors.

What changed was the market dynamic. Kelowna shifted firmly into buyer's market territory. Average days on market climbed from around 30 in the summer of 2022 to 44 by June 2023. Sales volumes were down significantly. The Association of Interior Realtors reported just 4,000 total sales in 2023, compared to roughly 8,000 during the hot market of 2021. Homes were taking longer to sell, and the average list-to-sell ratio showed buyers negotiating 2 to 3% discounts.

In 2024, the market entered what many analysts described as a stabilization phase. The benchmark for single-family homes in the Central Okanagan hovered around the low $1 million range, ending the year at approximately $1,020,000 in December 2024. Townhomes held at about $746,000 and condos at roughly $476,000, according to data reported by WOWA.

The Bank of Canada began cutting rates in mid-2024, eventually delivering nine rate reductions that brought the overnight rate from 5% down to 2.25% by October 2025. But the cuts came slowly, and each individual reduction wasn't enough on its own to reignite the market. Active listings continued to climb, reaching their highest levels in three years by late 2024, giving buyers more selection and more negotiating power than they'd had in years.

## Where Kelowna Home Prices Stand Heading into 2026

By mid-2025, the Kelowna market started showing genuine signs of recovery. The benchmark price for a single-family home in the Central Okanagan reached $1,067,500 in June 2025, up 5.8% year over year, according to the Association of Interior Realtors. Sales activity picked up as well, with 207 single-family homes sold in June 2025, a 13.1% increase over June 2024.

But the recovery hasn't been uniform across all property types. While single-family homes have shown price appreciation, townhomes have been essentially flat, and the condo market has struggled more noticeably. The Association of Interior Realtors data from January 2026 showed benchmark prices for single-family homes dipping slightly in year-over-year comparisons, while condo benchmarks declined across all Okanagan sub-regions.

January 2026 brought a typical seasonal slowdown, with 226 units sold across the Central Okanagan and about 13.8 months of supply on the market, firmly in buyer's market conditions. The average single-family sale price came in at $1,036,503 according to Coldwell Banker Horizon Realty's market overview. The Bank of Canada has held its overnight rate steady at 2.25% since October 2025, and most economists expect it to remain there through most of 2026.

## What's Driving Kelowna Property Values Going Forward

Several structural factors continue to support long-term price appreciation in Kelowna, even if the short-term picture remains choppy.

**Population growth remains strong.** The Kelowna metro area surpassed 250,000 residents in early 2024, and recent BC Statistics estimates place the population around 254,600. Growth has been driven primarily by interprovincial migration, particularly from the Lower Mainland and Alberta, along with a steady stream of retirees drawn by the Okanagan lifestyle. The $108 million terminal expansion at Kelowna International Airport, which opened its first phase in early 2026, signals that the region expects continued growth.

**Limited land supply puts a floor under prices.** Unlike sprawling prairie cities, Kelowna is geographically constrained by Okanagan Lake to the west and mountains to the east. The Agricultural Land Reserve protects large swaths of surrounding farmland from development. Single-family lots are becoming increasingly scarce, which is exactly why the city has pushed density in the downtown core with projects like the 42-storey Water Street by the Park tower.

**Affordability relative to Vancouver still matters.** The benchmark for a single-family home in Greater Vancouver was over $2 million in 2022 when Kelowna was hitting $1.1 million. Even with Kelowna's price appreciation, the gap remains significant enough to attract buyers looking for more space and a different lifestyle at a lower price point.

On the other side, **affordability is a real concern for local buyers.** The median household income in the Kelowna metro area is approximately $71,000 before tax, according to Mortgage Sandbox analysis. At current interest rates, that household can qualify for roughly a $270,000 mortgage, which isn't close to enough for any property type in the Central Okanagan without a substantial down payment. First-time buyers continue to face steep barriers, and until either incomes catch up or prices come down further, that tension isn't going away.

Trade uncertainty, particularly around the Canada-US-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) renewal, adds another layer of risk to the outlook. The Bank of Canada has flagged trade policy as a key variable that could force its hand in either direction on interest rates.

## Reading the Kelowna Housing Price Chart: Lessons from a Decade of Data

Looking at the full arc of **Kelowna real estate prices over time**, a few patterns jump out.

First, Kelowna doesn't crash the way some people fear. Even the 2018 correction and the 2022-2023 pullback brought prices down 10 to 15% from their peaks before stabilizing. Neither came close to wiping out the gains from the preceding run-up. A homeowner who bought a typical single-family home in 2016 for $550,000 is still sitting on a property worth roughly $1 million a decade later, even after the corrections.

Second, external forces matter enormously. Government policy (stress tests, speculation taxes, foreign buyer taxes), Bank of Canada rate decisions, and global events like COVID-19 have had more impact on short-term price movements than local supply and demand alone. You can't predict Kelowna's market without watching Ottawa and the Bank of Canada.

Third, timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, but buying into strength has worked well over longer time horizons. Every five-year window in the past decade has shown positive appreciation for single-family homes in the Central Okanagan, even if individual years within those windows saw pullbacks.

The current market offers something that hasn't been available in a while: time. With elevated inventory, longer days on market, and sellers who are more willing to negotiate, buyers have the luxury of being selective. That's a stark contrast to 2021 when you had to write an offer within hours and compete against a dozen other buyers.

For sellers, the key takeaway is that realistic pricing matters more than ever. The days of listing high and expecting multiple offers are gone for now. Properties priced correctly are still selling, but overpriced listings are sitting, and every week on market chips away at perceived value.`,
