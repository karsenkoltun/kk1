Suddenly you're in a multiple offer situation in Kelowna real estate, and the decisions you make in the next 24 hours could determine whether you get the keys or go back to searching.

Multiple offers don't happen on every listing. With roughly 3,100 active listings across the Central Okanagan as of January 2026 and properties taking an average of 92 days to sell, the broader market still favours buyers in many segments. But that doesn't mean competition has disappeared. Well-priced single-family homes in popular neighbourhoods like Glenmore, Lower Mission, and parts of Lake Country are still generating multiple bids, sometimes within days of hitting the MLS. According to local agents and recent market reports, properties that are strategically priced and professionally presented continue to attract competing offers and occasionally sell above asking, even in a market where the average list-to-sell ratio sits around 90%.

Winning a bidding war isn't about throwing the most money at the wall. It's about building an offer that's clean, credible, and hard for a seller to say no to. Here's how to do it.

<!-- STATS -->

## Get Your Pre-Approval Locked In Before You Start Looking

This might sound basic, but it's where most buyers either build a strong foundation or start on shaky ground. A mortgage pre-approval isn't just a nice-to-have. It's your credibility card. When a seller is comparing three or four offers side by side, the one backed by a verified pre-approval from a reputable lender stands out immediately.

A pre-approval letter tells the seller three things: you've already been vetted by a lender, your financing is real, and the deal is less likely to fall apart over a financing condition. In a competitive real estate market like Kelowna's most desirable pockets, that kind of certainty carries serious weight.

As of February 2026, the Bank of Canada's policy rate sits at 2.25%, with most lenders holding prime at 4.45%. The best five-year fixed rates for insured buyers are around 3.69% to 3.9%, while competitive variable rates start as low as 3.35%. These numbers matter because your pre-approval amount directly determines your ceiling in a bidding war.

**Get pre-approved for the maximum you qualify for, but set your own internal limit based on what you're actually comfortable paying each month.** The stress test still qualifies you at your contract rate plus 2%, so your actual borrowing power may be $50,000 to $100,000 less than you'd expect. Know that number cold before you write any offers. Most pre-approvals also lock in your rate for 90 to 120 days, protecting you if bond yields push fixed rates higher while you're shopping.

## Understand What Sellers Actually Care About (It's Not Always Price)

Here's something that surprises a lot of buyers: the highest offer doesn't always win. Sellers evaluate the full package, and in many cases, the terms of the offer matter just as much as the dollar amount.

Think about it from the seller's perspective. They've accepted your offer, started planning their move, and then the deal collapses because financing fell through or the inspection scared you off. Now they're back on the market with a stale listing. Sellers dread that scenario, which is why the strength of your offer often trumps a slightly higher number from a less certain buyer.

Here's what sellers in Kelowna's competitive real estate market tend to prioritize:

**Fewer conditions.** Every condition (financing, inspection, insurance, appraisal) represents risk for the seller. An offer with a tight two-day financing condition looks far better than one asking for a week. An offer with no financing condition at all, because you've already secured firm approval, is even stronger. That said, never waive your home inspection condition without fully understanding the risk. More on that below.

**A flexible closing date.** Ask the listing agent what timeline works best for the seller. If they need 60 days to find their next home, matching that timeline can tip the scales in your favour. If they want to close quickly, be ready to move.

**A compelling deposit.** We'll cover deposit strategy in detail, but a larger deposit signals commitment and reduces the seller's perception of risk.

**A clean offer.** No unusual clauses, no requests for chattels that weren't included, no complicated conditions. The simpler your offer reads, the more confident the seller feels accepting it.

## Your Offer Strategy: How to Structure a Winning Bid

When multiple offers are on the table in Kelowna real estate, the way you build your offer matters as much as the price you write on it. A well-structured bid can beat a higher-priced competitor if it communicates seriousness, flexibility, and low risk.

**Start with a price that reflects reality, not emotion.** Your agent should pull comparable sales from the past 60 to 90 days in the same neighbourhood. In the Central Okanagan, where the average single-family home sold for approximately $1,036,503 in January 2026 (with a median of $945,000), recent comparables will give you a clear picture of what the market actually supports. If a home is listed at $899,000 and comps suggest it's worth $920,000, your opening number needs to reflect that gap, especially if you know other buyers are circling.

**Consider your offer price in relation to the listing strategy.** Some sellers deliberately price below market value to generate buzz and invite a bidding war. If a home in Glenmore is listed at $849,000 but comparable properties have sold between $880,000 and $910,000, the low list price is a strategy. Don't anchor your offer to the asking price. Anchor it to what the home is actually worth based on sold data.

**Minimize your conditions, but do it smartly.** In a bidding war, a subject-free offer carries the most weight. But going in without any safety nets requires preparation. If you're considering removing the financing condition, make sure your lender has given you a firm commitment, not just a pre-approval. If you're thinking about skipping the inspection, consider getting a pre-inspection done before you submit your offer (more on this shortly). Removing conditions without doing your homework isn't bold. It's reckless.

**Shorten your condition periods.** If you're not comfortable going subject-free, tighten the timelines. Instead of a standard five-business-day financing condition, ask your mortgage broker if they can confirm within 48 hours. Instead of a seven-day inspection window, have an inspector lined up and ready to go the morning after acceptance. Shorter conditions reduce the seller's risk while still protecting you.

## Escalation Clauses: A Powerful Bidding War Tool

An escalation clause is one of the most effective tools you can use in a multiple offer situation, and it's something every buyer competing for a desirable property in Kelowna should understand.

Here's how it works: you submit your initial offer at a set price, but include a clause that automatically increases your bid by a specific increment if the seller receives a higher competing offer. The clause keeps escalating your price until it reaches a cap you've predetermined, your maximum.

For example, say you offer $875,000 on a home in the Upper Mission with an escalation clause that increases your bid by $5,000 over any competing offer, up to a ceiling of $910,000. If the next highest offer comes in at $885,000, your offer automatically rises to $890,000. If another buyer bids $900,000, yours climbs to $905,000. You never pay more than your cap, and you only pay as much as you need to beat the competition.

A few important considerations. Always require that the seller provide written proof of the competing offer that triggered your escalation. This prevents manipulation. Your clause should also specify that competing offers must come from unrelated parties, not the seller's cousin submitting a phantom bid to drive up your price. And understand that not every seller will accept escalation clauses. Some prefer a straightforward "highest and best" approach. Have your agent check with the listing agent before including one.

The strategic advantage is that your initial offer price holds if no higher bids materialize. You only escalate when there's genuine competition. One risk to be aware of: the clause reveals your maximum price to the seller. Use it when you're confident the property will sell in the current round of offers.

## Deposit Strategy: Why a Bigger Deposit Wins More Deals

Your deposit, sometimes called earnest money, is the amount you put down when the seller accepts your offer. In British Columbia, the standard deposit is typically around 5% of the purchase price, held in trust by the buyer's agent's brokerage until completion. But in a multiple offer situation, bumping that number up can make your offer significantly more attractive.

Why? Because a larger deposit signals that you have real financial commitment to this transaction. It tells the seller you're not shopping around or likely to get cold feet. If two offers are identical in price and conditions, but one comes with a $20,000 deposit and the other with a $50,000 deposit, the seller will almost always lean toward the larger deposit. It reduces their perceived risk.

A strong deposit strategy in the Kelowna real estate market might look like this: on a $900,000 home, instead of the minimum $45,000 (5%), consider offering $70,000 or even $90,000. The deposit isn't an additional cost; it gets applied to your down payment at closing. You're not spending extra money. You're moving it up in the timeline to demonstrate seriousness. Just make sure the money is liquid and accessible, because most offers require deposit delivery within 24 hours of acceptance.

## Bidding War Tips That Give You an Edge Beyond Price

Price matters in a competitive real estate market, but the buyers who consistently win in Kelowna's multiple offer scenarios are the ones who pay attention to the details that other buyers overlook.

**Get a pre-inspection done.** If you know a property is going to attract competing offers, book a home inspection before the offer deadline. Yes, this costs $400 to $600 and you might not end up buying the home, but it gives you a massive advantage. You can submit a subject-free offer on the inspection condition with confidence, knowing exactly what you're buying. In the Okanagan specifically, pay attention to foundation condition, roof age, and any signs of moisture intrusion, common issues that surprise buyers in this climate.

**Include a personal letter (when appropriate).** Some listing agents discourage it, but when the seller is emotionally attached to their home, a brief, genuine letter explaining why you love the property can tip the scales. Keep it short and real.

**Use a local lender or broker.** Sellers and their agents feel more comfortable when financing is handled by a known local lender. A Kelowna-based mortgage broker who can speak directly with the listing agent about your financial readiness makes a real difference.

**Be responsive and available.** In a multiple offer scenario, things move fast. During offer night, have your phone on and be ready to make quick decisions. If the listing agent calls with a question and you're unreachable for three hours, that's a problem.

**Know your walkaway number.** Before you submit an offer, decide the absolute maximum you're willing to pay for this specific property. Write it down. Tell your agent. A clear, pre-determined ceiling prevents emotional decisions that lead to overpaying.

## When to Walk Away from a Multiple Offer Situation

Not every bidding war is worth winning. One of the smartest offer strategies is knowing when a deal no longer makes sense for you.

If the price has been pushed well above what recent comparable sales support, you're entering dangerous territory. When your purchase price exceeds what the home would likely appraise for, your lender will only finance up to the appraised value, and you'll need to come up with the difference in cash. If you don't have that cash available, the deal falls apart.

With roughly 940 active single-family listings and another 685 condos available across the Central Okanagan as of January 2026, there is inventory out there. Walking away from one overheated bidding war often means finding a better opportunity the following week, one where you can negotiate from a position of strength instead of desperation. Industry experts forecast slow, gradual recovery for the Kelowna market through 2026, which means the window for smart buyers isn't closing anytime soon. Patience is a legitimate strategy.

## Putting It All Together: Your Multiple Offer Game Plan

Winning a multiple offer situation in Kelowna real estate comes down to preparation. The buyers who succeed had their financing locked in weeks before they found the right property, understood what sellers prioritize, and built offers that were clean, competitive, and backed by real financial credibility.

Get pre-approved with a locked rate, research comparable sales so your price is anchored in data, minimize or shorten conditions without taking reckless risks, use an escalation clause when competition is expected, put down a strong deposit, and know your walkaway number before the bidding starts.`,
