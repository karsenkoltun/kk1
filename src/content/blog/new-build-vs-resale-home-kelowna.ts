  content: `If you're shopping for a **new build vs resale home in Kelowna**, you're facing one of the biggest forks in the road of any home search. Kelowna has no shortage of either option right now. There are 35 projects currently under construction across the city, with close to 6,800 new units in the pipeline. At the same time, resale inventory is sitting higher than it has in years, giving buyers more choice than they've had since before the pandemic.

Both paths can get you into a great home. But the financial math, the timeline, and the experience of buying each one are completely different. This guide breaks down everything you actually need to weigh, from GST and warranty coverage to customization, long-term resale value, and what each option really costs in the Kelowna market right now.

## What Counts as New Construction in Kelowna?

Before diving into the comparison, it helps to define what "new build" actually means, because it covers a few different buying experiences.

**Presale homes in Kelowna** are properties you purchase before construction is finished, sometimes before it even starts. You're buying based on floor plans, renderings, and a developer's track record. Presale condos and townhomes have become increasingly common in Kelowna, with developments like Water Street by the Park (a triple-tower project on Leon Ave with towers up to 42 storeys), Mission Group's projects on Bertram Street, and multiple townhome communities in Glenmore, McKinley Beach, and the Upper Mission all offering presale opportunities.

Then there are **spec homes**, where a builder constructs a home on their own land without a specific buyer lined up. You get something close to move-in ready, often with the option to choose finishes if you buy early enough.

Finally, there's **custom building**, where you purchase a lot and hire a builder to construct a home to your specifications. Communities like Wilden and McKinley Beach offer lots for custom builds, with builders like Dilworth Homes and Emil Anderson active in the area.

Resale homes are everything else. Any property that's been previously owned and occupied, regardless of age, is considered a resale. That could mean a 2-year-old townhouse or a 40-year-old rancher in Rutland.

## The True Cost Difference: New Construction vs Resale Kelowna Prices

Here's where the new build vs resale conversation gets interesting, and where most people underestimate the gap.

As of the end of 2025, the benchmark price for a single-family home in Kelowna sat at **$1,045,700**, according to the Association of Interior Realtors year-end report. Townhomes came in at a benchmark of **$675,700**, while condos landed at **$470,600**. Those are resale benchmarks, reflecting what typical existing homes are actually trading for.

<!-- STATS -->

**New construction in Kelowna** carries a premium. Presale condos in the city are typically priced between **$700 and $1,200 per square foot** as of 2025. A 750-square-foot one-bedroom presale condo could start around $525,000 and climb past $900,000 depending on the building, floor, and view. New single-family homes in communities like McKinley Beach or the Upper Mission often start above $1 million and can reach well into the $1.5 million to $2 million range for larger builds.

But the sticker price isn't the full story. With a new build, you need to factor in:

- **GST (5%)**: This is the big one. Resale homes are exempt from GST. New homes are not. On a $1 million new build, that's $50,000 in tax. More on the rebates below.
- **Upgrade costs**: That showroom you walked through? Many of those finishes were upgrades. Standard specifications in new builds can be basic. Flooring, countertop, appliance, and fixture upgrades can add $20,000 to $80,000+ depending on the home.
- **Landscaping and fencing**: New homes, especially detached builds, often come with bare lots. Budget $10,000 to $30,000 or more to finish the exterior.
- **Window coverings, lighting, and appliances**: Not always included, especially in presale condos.

With a resale home, you're typically buying a property where all of that is already done. The trade-off is that some of it may be dated or worn, and you might spend money on renovations down the road.

## GST on New Homes: What Kelowna Buyers Need to Know

The **GST implications of buying new construction** are one of the most significant financial differences between a new build and a resale home. Resale homes in BC don't attract GST. New homes do.

In British Columbia, the **5% GST** applies to all newly built homes. The 7% provincial sales tax (PST) does not apply to newly constructed homes purchased from builders, which is a meaningful distinction compared to provinces with HST.

There are rebate programs that can offset some or all of that cost:

**The existing GST New Housing Rebate** allows buyers to recover 36% of the GST paid, up to a maximum rebate of $6,300. However, this rebate begins to phase out once the home's price exceeds $350,000 and disappears completely at $450,000. Given that virtually every new home in Kelowna exceeds that threshold, most buyers in this market get nothing from the traditional rebate.

**The new First-Time Home Buyers' GST Rebate**, introduced in May 2025, is a different story. This program can eliminate the entire 5% federal GST for eligible first-time buyers purchasing a **new home valued up to $1 million**, with savings of up to $50,000. The rebate phases out between $1 million and $1.5 million. To qualify, you must be a first-time buyer, the agreement of purchase and sale must be signed on or after May 27, 2025, and the home must be your primary residence. Construction must begin before 2031 and be substantially completed before 2036.

This is a substantial shift. For a first-time buyer purchasing a $900,000 new townhome in Kelowna, that's $45,000 in GST savings that didn't exist before mid-2025. It genuinely changes the math on **buying a new home in Kelowna** for anyone entering the market for the first time.

If you're not a first-time buyer, though, the full 5% GST applies with minimal rebate relief on Kelowna-priced homes.

## BC's 2-5-10 Warranty: The Built-In Safety Net for New Builds

One of the strongest arguments for **new construction in Kelowna** is the warranty protection that comes standard with every new home built by a licensed residential builder in BC.

Under the provincial Homeowner Protection Act, all new homes must carry **2-5-10 home warranty insurance**. This isn't optional, and it isn't something the builder can skip. Here's what it covers:

**2 years of coverage for materials and labour defects.** This includes issues with workmanship, installation problems, and defects in materials. Electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are covered for the full 24 months. For detached homes, general materials and labour defects are covered for 12 months; for common property in strata buildings, it's 15 months.

**5 years of building envelope coverage.** This protects against defects that allow unintended water penetration into the home. Given the Okanagan's climate variations, from heavy spring rains to winter freeze-thaw cycles, building envelope integrity matters.

**10 years of structural coverage.** This covers defects in load-bearing components: the foundation, beams, columns, and anything that affects the home's structural safety.

A few important details that buyers often miss: the warranty **stays with the home, not the owner**. If you sell your new build within 10 years, the remaining coverage transfers to the next buyer. That's a selling point when it comes time to list. Coverage limits are set at the lesser of the first owner's purchase price or $200,000 for detached homes, and $100,000 for strata units.

Resale homes don't come with this kind of protection. If you buy a 15-year-old home and the furnace fails six months later, that's on you. A home inspection can catch existing problems, but it can't predict what will break next year.

## Customization and Design: Where New Builds Pull Ahead

The ability to customize is one of the most appealing parts of **buying a new home in Kelowna**, and it's something the resale market simply can't match.

With a presale condo or townhome, developers typically offer a selection of colour schemes and finish packages. You might choose between light and dark cabinetry, quartz or laminate counters, and engineered hardwood or vinyl plank flooring. Some higher-end **Kelowna new developments** allow more extensive customization, including layout modifications, appliance upgrades, and smart home features.

Custom-built homes take this even further. If you're building on a lot in Wilden, McKinley Beach, or the Upper Mission, you're choosing the floor plan, the ceiling heights, the window placement, and every finish in the house. You're also building to the latest BC Building Code standards, which means better insulation, tighter building envelopes, more energy-efficient systems, and modern electrical capacity for things like EV chargers and home offices.

With a resale home, what you see is what you get. You might find a home with great bones in a fantastic location, but the kitchen was last updated in 2005 and the bathrooms are original. Renovating a resale home to match the finish level of a new build is absolutely possible, but it comes with its own costs, timelines, and headaches. A full kitchen renovation in Kelowna can easily run $30,000 to $80,000 depending on scope. Bathroom renovations typically fall between $15,000 and $40,000 each.

The flip side? Resale homes in established Kelowna neighbourhoods often sit on larger lots with mature landscaping, something that takes 10 to 20 years to develop in a new community. Many older homes also have architectural character that's hard to replicate in modern builds, with features like solid wood trim, larger room proportions, and unique layouts that reflect a different era of design.

## Resale Value and Long-Term Investment Considerations

This is where the conversation gets nuanced. The question every buyer wants answered is: which one is the better investment?

**New builds can carry a "new premium"** that doesn't always hold. Similar to buying a new car, the moment you move into a new construction home, it becomes a "used" home on the resale market. If a developer is still selling units in your building or homes on your street, a potential buyer can choose between your place and a brand new one, and they'll often choose new. Some industry analysis suggests new builds can lose around 7% or more of their value premium in the first few years simply by no longer being new.

That said, this effect is less pronounced in markets where supply is tight, and it tends to flatten out within five to seven years as the neighbourhood matures and the home's age becomes less of a factor.

**Resale homes in established neighbourhoods** have a different value proposition. They sit on land that's already proven its worth. The neighbourhood amenities, schools, parks, and transit connections, are already in place. Mature areas in Kelowna like the Lower Mission, Upper Mission, and Glenmore have decades of appreciation history behind them. The land component of these properties often drives a higher percentage of total value compared to new developments where the land may still be maturing.

For the Kelowna market specifically, the data tells an interesting story. The benchmark price for single-family homes ended 2025 at $1,045,700, down just 0.7% from 2024 but still off 7.45% from the April 2022 peak of $1,131,800. Townhomes have seen a steeper correction, with the benchmark at $675,700, down 9.5% year-over-year and 18.5% below the May 2022 peak. Condos have been relatively flat, down 0.2% year-over-year to $470,600.

This tells us that the resale market has been cooling and correcting. For buyers, that means more negotiating power on resale homes than you'd have with a developer selling presale units at set price lists. Developers rarely discount. Individual sellers often will.

The sales-to-new-listings ratio in Kelowna has hovered between 40% and 45%, placing the city firmly in balanced market territory. In December 2025, only 12% of listed single-family homes actually sold, 13% of townhouses, and just 7% of condos. That's a buyer's environment, and it overwhelmingly benefits those shopping in the resale market where individual sellers are more flexible on price.

## Making Your Decision: A Practical Framework

There's no universally correct answer to the **new build vs resale home** question. It depends entirely on your priorities, your timeline, and your financial situation. Here's a practical way to think through it.

**A new build might be right for you if:**

You're a first-time buyer who can take advantage of the new GST rebate (potentially saving up to $50,000). You value modern finishes, energy efficiency, and warranty protection. You don't need to move immediately and can wait for construction to complete. You want a home that requires zero renovation work on day one. You're comfortable with a developing neighbourhood where amenities may still be coming.

**A resale home might be right for you if:**

You want to live in an established neighbourhood with mature trees, walkable amenities, and proven community character. You prefer to avoid paying GST entirely. You want more negotiating room on price and more flexibility in the buying process. You're handy or willing to invest in renovations over time to customize the home to your taste. You need to move on a predictable timeline without construction delays.

**A few more practical considerations:**

Financing can differ between the two. Presale purchases require deposits paid over the construction period, typically 15% to 25% of the purchase price, spread across several installments before the mortgage kicks in. You won't have possession or a place to live during that time, so you're paying rent or carrying another home while your deposits sit with the developer. With a resale home, you know your closing date, your possession date, and exactly what you're getting.

**Inspection timing matters too.** With a resale home, you can (and absolutely should) get a full home inspection before you buy. With a presale, you don't inspect the finished product until the deficiency walkthrough, which happens close to completion. You're trusting the builder's quality until that point. Check the builder's track record, read their warranty provider reviews, and look at their completed projects before committing.`,
