  content: `If you're looking at condos or townhomes anywhere in British Columbia, you've already noticed that number sitting right below the listing price: the monthly strata fee. **Strata fees BC explained** in plain terms is exactly what this guide delivers, because that monthly figure deserves more than a glance before you sign an offer. Some Kelowna condos list strata fees at $300 a month. Others push past $800. The difference isn't random, and understanding what drives it could save you thousands of dollars (or help you spot a deal hiding behind a fee that looks intimidating on paper).

Strata fees, sometimes called condo fees or maintenance fees, are mandatory monthly contributions every owner in a strata corporation pays to keep shared spaces and systems functioning. They cover everything from building insurance and landscaping to elevator maintenance and snow removal. But the real story is in the details, and the details vary wildly from one building to the next.

## How Strata Fees Are Calculated in British Columbia

Every strata corporation in BC is required under the Strata Property Act to draft an annual budget. That budget forecasts all anticipated expenses for the coming year, and it's presented for approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Once approved, the total gets divided among all owners based on something called **unit entitlement**.

Unit entitlement is essentially a number assigned to each strata lot that represents its proportional share of the building's total value or square footage. A 1,200 square foot corner unit will carry a higher unit entitlement than a 650 square foot studio down the hall, and its owner will pay a larger share of the monthly fees. This is why two people living in the same building can have noticeably different strata fees.

Across British Columbia, strata fees typically range from **$0.30 to $0.75 per square foot per month**. In Kelowna specifically, the average sits closer to $0.35 per square foot, which tends to be lower than Metro Vancouver where density, labour costs, and higher insurance premiums push fees upward. For a typical 900 square foot condo in Kelowna, that works out to roughly $315 per month at the average rate. Newer downtown towers with pools, gyms, and concierge services will push well above that range, while basic townhome complexes with minimal shared amenities can come in under $0.20 per square foot.

Here's the part that catches buyers off guard: strata fees are not negotiable. The fee is determined by the approved budget and your unit's entitlement, and every owner is legally required to pay. Missing payments can lead to interest charges, liens on your property, and in extreme cases, forced sale proceedings.

## What Do Strata Fees Cover in BC?

The short answer is that strata fees fund two separate accounts: the **operating fund** and the **contingency reserve fund (CRF)**. Understanding the difference between these two is fundamental to evaluating any strata property.

The operating fund covers day-to-day and recurring expenses. Think of it as the checking account that keeps the building running on a daily and seasonal basis. Common operating fund expenses include:

- **Building insurance** for common property (not your individual unit contents or liability, which you need separate coverage for)
- **Property management fees** paid to the strata management company
- **Landscaping and snow removal**, which in Kelowna is a meaningful line item given the winter climate
- **Cleaning and maintenance** of hallways, lobbies, parkades, and other common areas
- **Utilities for shared spaces**, including water, sewer, garbage collection, and sometimes heat or hot water
- **Elevator maintenance and inspection contracts**
- **Amenity upkeep** for pools, fitness centres, guest suites, and common rooms

Many Kelowna stratas include water and sewer in the monthly fee, with service varying by location (City of Kelowna Utility, Rutland Waterworks, Glenmore-Ellison Improvement District, or South East Kelowna Irrigation District). Some buildings with central boiler systems also include heat and hot water, which can meaningfully reduce your separate FortisBC bill. Always confirm exactly which utilities are bundled into the strata fees, because this directly affects your actual monthly housing cost.

The contingency reserve fund is the savings account. It's designated for expenses that occur less than once a year or that fall outside normal operations. Roof replacements, elevator overhauls, parkade membrane repairs, exterior repainting, major plumbing projects: these are all CRF territory.

As of **November 1, 2023**, BC law requires every strata corporation to contribute a minimum of **10% of the annual operating fund budget** to the CRF each year. Most well-managed stratas contribute more than this minimum. A healthy CRF balance is one of the strongest indicators that a building is being proactively maintained and that owners are less likely to face sudden special levies.

What strata fees **don't** cover is equally important. You're still responsible for your own electricity (BC Hydro or FortisBC Electric depending on area), internet, individual unit insurance, property taxes, and any repairs inside your unit's walls. The strata handles everything on the common property side; everything within your four walls is on you.

## Strata Fees in Kelowna: What to Expect by Property Type

**Strata fees Kelowna** buyers encounter vary significantly based on building type, age, and amenities. Here's a realistic picture of what you'll see on the MLS.

**Condominiums** in Kelowna typically range from $300 to $600 per month. Newer buildings in the downtown core or Pandosy Village may start lower because the mechanical systems are brand new and under warranty. Buildings with pools, gyms, and concierge services sit at the higher end, and luxury waterfront towers can push past $800.

**Townhomes** generally carry lower fees because there are fewer shared amenities. Many townhome complexes only share landscaping, snow removal, exterior maintenance, and insurance, without elevator contracts and amenity budgets. Expect $200 to $450 per month for most Kelowna townhome stratas.

**Bare land stratas** are a unique category where you own both the land and building but share infrastructure like private roads and water systems. These tend to have the lowest fees, sometimes under $200 monthly, though you're responsible for more of your own property maintenance.

A critical principle to remember: **low strata fees aren't automatically good news**. A building charging $250 a month while sitting on a thin contingency reserve fund and deferring major maintenance is a far riskier purchase than one charging $450 with a healthy CRF balance and a proactive maintenance plan. The cheapest strata fee often belongs to the building most likely to hit you with a special levy.

## The Depreciation Report: Your 30-Year Crystal Ball

If there's one document you should read before **buying a strata in BC**, it's the depreciation report. This is a comprehensive assessment of a building's common property and assets that projects maintenance, repair, and replacement costs over a 30-year timeline. It tells you what's going to need work, when it'll need it, and approximately how much it will cost.

As of **July 1, 2024**, all strata corporations in British Columbia with five or more lots are required to obtain a depreciation report. The previous loophole that allowed stratas to indefinitely defer this requirement with an annual three-quarter vote has been eliminated. Reports must now be updated every five years, and strata corporations can no longer opt out.

The deadlines for compliance are staggered by region. Stratas in Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, and the Capital Regional District must have their reports completed by **July 1, 2026**. For stratas in the rest of BC, including the Central Okanagan, the deadline extends to **July 1, 2027**. Starting July 1, 2025, reports must be prepared by designated professionals: engineers, architects, applied science technologists, accredited appraisers, certified reserve planners, or quantity surveyors.

A **strata depreciation report** typically includes an inventory of all common property components (roofing, windows, elevator systems, plumbing, parkade membranes, exterior cladding), their current condition based on an on-site inspection, estimated remaining service life, and projected replacement costs. Most importantly, it presents **three funding models** showing different strategies for how the strata could pay for upcoming work.

When reviewing a depreciation report, pay close attention to the gap between what the building should be saving annually and what it's actually contributing to the CRF. A building that's underfunding relative to its depreciation report projections is essentially kicking the can down the road, and current owners will eventually pay the price through fee increases or special levies.

## Special Levies, the Form B, and Documents Every Buyer Should Review

Special levies are one-time charges imposed on strata lot owners to cover significant expenses that exceed what the operating fund and CRF can handle. They require approval by at least a **three-quarter vote** of owners at a general meeting. Think of them as the emergency fundraiser when the building needs a new roof or extensive parkade repairs, and there isn't enough money in the reserve fund.

Special levies can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands. A building that deferred maintenance for years and now needs a full envelope remediation could levy $30,000 or more per unit. This is exactly why reviewing the CRF balance and depreciation report before purchasing is so important.

When evaluating a potential strata purchase, always check whether any special levies have been approved but not yet collected, or whether any are being discussed at recent council meetings. This information appears on the **Form B: Information Certificate**, the key disclosure document every buyer should request.

The **Form B: Information Certificate** is arguably the single most important document when **buying a strata in BC**. The strata corporation must provide it within seven days of a request, for a maximum fee of $35 plus copying charges. It discloses the monthly strata fee, any amounts the current owner owes, whether parking and storage are included, the CRF balance, and whether the strata is involved in any lawsuits or Civil Resolution Tribunal proceedings. Attached must be copies of the strata's current rules, annual budget, and most recent depreciation report.

Beyond the Form B, smart buyers also review **AGM minutes from the last two to three years** (these reveal upcoming projects, contentious votes, and the overall tone of the community), **financial statements** (compare actual spending against the budget to spot overspending patterns), and **the strata's bylaws**. Since November 2022 under Bill 44, strata corporations in BC can no longer restrict long-term rentals, which is significant for investors. However, stratas can still ban or limit short-term rentals like Airbnb, with fines of up to $1,000 per day for violations. Age restrictions are now limited to 55-plus communities only.

Also check the **building's insurance policy**. Strata insurance premiums across BC have risen sharply in recent years, flowing directly into strata fees. Pay attention to the deductible amount: if a claim is filed (water damage is the most common), the responsible party may be on the hook for a deductible running $25,000 to $100,000 or more in some buildings.

## Red Flags and Green Lights When Evaluating Strata Fees

Not every strata property is a good purchase, and the strata fees themselves can tell you a lot about the building's health if you know what to look for.

**Unusually low fees relative to the building's age and amenities.** If a 30-year-old building with an elevator, pool, and underground parkade is charging $280 a month, something isn't adding up. Either the CRF is underfunded, maintenance is being deferred, or a special levy is on the horizon. Low fees feel great until the assessment notice arrives.

**A thin contingency reserve fund.** There's no universal dollar figure that defines "healthy," but the CRF balance should be viewed alongside the depreciation report's recommended funding level. If the report says the building should have $500,000 in reserves and the actual balance is $120,000, that's a serious gap.

**No depreciation report or a severely outdated one.** With BC's new requirements eliminating the ability to defer, a strata without a current depreciation report is either behind on compliance or avoiding a clear picture of its financial future.

**Pending or recent litigation.** The Form B discloses whether the strata is involved in lawsuits. Construction defect claims or owner-versus-strata disputes can drain the CRF and lead to special levies.

**A pattern of large annual fee increases.** Modest increases of 3% to 5% annually are normal given rising insurance and inflation. But if fees have jumped 15% to 20% year over year for multiple years, it signals the building was previously underfunded and is playing catch-up.

**Self-managed stratas with minimal documentation.** Some smaller stratas operate without a professional management company. This can work well with diligent council members, but it can also mean inconsistent record-keeping and less transparency. If a self-managed strata can't produce clean financial statements and current meeting minutes, proceed with caution.

On the flip side, here's a perspective shift: **strata fees aren't a penalty for not owning a detached house. They're a pre-paid maintenance and insurance fund.** Every homeowner pays for insurance, snow removal, landscaping, roof repairs, and exterior upkeep. Detached home owners just pay those costs individually and often reactively, which means budgeting is less predictable and big-ticket repairs can hit without warning.

Strata fees pool those costs across all owners and smooth them out into a predictable monthly payment. A well-run strata with reasonable fees, a healthy CRF, a current depreciation report, and proactive council is one of the most financially transparent forms of homeownership available.

The key is doing your homework before you buy. Review the Form B and its attachments. Read the depreciation report. Check the CRF balance against what it should be. Ask your Realtor to help you interpret what you're seeing. Ten minutes of document review can save you from inheriting someone else's deferred maintenance problem.`,
