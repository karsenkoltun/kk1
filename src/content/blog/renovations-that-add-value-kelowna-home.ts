Some projects will put money back in your pocket when it's time to sell. Others will drain your budget and barely move the needle on your home's value. Knowing which **renovations add the most value** is the difference between a smart investment and an expensive lesson.

With the benchmark price of a single-family home in Kelowna sitting at $1,045,700 as of December 2025 (according to the Association of Interior Realtors), even a modest percentage bump in value translates into serious dollars. A renovation that returns 70% to 80% on a $60,000 spend could mean $42,000 to $48,000 back at the offer table. That's not pocket change.

But here's the thing. Kelowna isn't Toronto. It isn't Vancouver. What adds value in a downtown condo tower doesn't always translate to a family home in Glenmore or a rancher in Rutland. The Okanagan lifestyle, the climate, and what local buyers actually prioritize all play a role in which home improvements deliver the **best home renovations ROI** in this market.

Let's break down the projects that matter most, what they'll cost you locally, and where to focus your dollars for the biggest return.

## Kitchen Renovation Value: The Project That Pays You Back

There's a reason 93.5% of RE/MAX brokers across Canada identified kitchen renovations as the single best ROI project for resale. The kitchen is the heart of the home, and buyers in Kelowna are no different from buyers anywhere else in this regard. A dated kitchen with laminate counters and mismatched appliances will cost you at the offer table. A clean, modern kitchen with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances will make buyers feel like they can move right in.

<!-- STATS -->

In Kelowna, a mid-range kitchen remodel typically costs between **$60,000 and $80,000**, according to local contractor estimates from LUX Quality Homes. That includes semi-custom cabinetry, quartz countertops, standard appliances, and updated lighting. If you're going the luxury route with custom millwork, high-end appliances, and natural stone finishes, expect to cross the $100,000 mark.

The good news? **Kitchen renovation value** holds strong. Industry data consistently places kitchen ROI at around 75% to 80% in balanced markets. On a $70,000 mid-range kitchen remodel in Kelowna, that's roughly $52,000 to $56,000 recouped at resale.

A few tips to maximize your return without blowing the budget:

- **Keep the existing layout.** The moment you start moving plumbing or gas lines, costs jump significantly. Work with the footprint you have.
- **Focus on countertops and cabinets first.** These are the two elements buyers notice immediately. Quartz has become the standard that Kelowna buyers expect.
- **Swap appliances as a package.** A matching stainless steel set looks polished and photographs well for listings. You don't need the commercial-grade range; mid-tier brands like Bosch or KitchenAid hit the sweet spot of quality and value.
- **Don't over-renovate for your neighbourhood.** A $120,000 kitchen in a home listed at $750,000 in Rutland won't deliver the same return as that kitchen in a $1.3 million home in the Lower Mission. Match your renovation to local comparables.

If you can only afford one major renovation before selling, make it the kitchen. Full stop.

## Bathroom Renovation Value: Small Rooms, Big Returns

Bathrooms are the second most impactful renovation for resale, and 61.3% of RE/MAX brokers identified them as a high-return project. The logic is simple. Buyers don't want to deal with the disruption, cost, and inconvenience of ripping out a bathroom after they move in. If yours looks tired, they'll mentally subtract the renovation cost from their offer, and then some.

In Kelowna, **bathroom renovation** costs vary quite a bit depending on scope. A standard 3-piece bathroom (tub or shower, toilet, vanity) runs in the range of $15,000 to $35,000 at local contractors like ARG Contracting and Nailed It Developments. A master ensuite with double sinks, a separate tub and shower, heated floors, and frameless glass can push $40,000 or higher.

**Bathroom renovation value** typically delivers around 60% to 70% ROI, with mid-range projects performing better on a percentage basis than luxury overhauls. A $25,000 bathroom refresh that modernizes tile, replaces the vanity, installs a new toilet, and adds updated lighting can easily return $15,000 to $17,500 in perceived value.

Here's what moves the needle for Kelowna buyers specifically:

- **Walk-in showers over tubs** in ensuites. The spa-inspired bathroom trend is strong in the Okanagan, and buyers under 50 overwhelmingly prefer a large, tiled walk-in shower to a soaker tub in the master bathroom.
- **Heated floors.** They're one of the most requested upgrades in Kelowna according to local contractors, and they make a huge difference during Okanagan winters. The cost to add in-floor radiant heat during a bathroom renovation is modest compared to the comfort and perceived value it delivers.
- **Matte black or brushed gold fixtures.** Chrome still works, but modern fixture finishes immediately signal an updated space. Swapping out all the hardware, faucets, and towel bars in a bathroom can cost under $1,000 and completely change the feel.
- **Proper ventilation.** Kelowna's dry summers mask this, but moisture damage from inadequate bathroom ventilation is a real issue in older homes. A quality exhaust fan is a small cost that prevents big problems.

If your home has two or more bathrooms, prioritize the ensuite. That's the one buyers walk into first, and first impressions carry outsized weight.

## Curb Appeal and Landscaping: The Fastest Win for Kelowna Home Improvement

Here's a renovation truth that surprises most homeowners. Curb appeal projects consistently deliver some of the highest returns on investment, and they cost a fraction of interior renovations. Research from the National Association of Realtors suggests that landscape maintenance projects can recoup close to 100% of their cost at resale. One survey found that investing roughly $3,500 in curb appeal can yield around $12,000 in increased value.

Why? Because buyers make emotional decisions, and that emotion starts the moment they pull up to your house. Or, more realistically, the moment they scroll past your listing photo online. Over 90% of homebuyers view listings online before they ever book a showing. If your exterior looks neglected in photos, many won't bother coming to see the inside.

In Kelowna, **curb appeal** matters even more because outdoor living is central to the Okanagan lifestyle. Buyers want to envision summer barbecues, evening wine on the patio, and mornings with a coffee overlooking a well-kept yard. Here's where to focus:

**Fresh paint** is one of the simplest, highest-return improvements you can make. A professional exterior paint job on a 2,000-square-foot home runs roughly $10,000 to $15,000 in Canada, with an estimated 60% ROI. Even just painting the front door a bold, welcoming colour can transform a home's street presence for under $200.

**Landscaping** doesn't need to be elaborate. Clean edges, fresh mulch, trimmed shrubs, seasonal flowers along the walkway, and a healthy green lawn signal pride of ownership. Professional landscaping services can boost a property's perceived value by 5% to 15% according to multiple industry studies. In dollar terms on a $1 million Kelowna home, that's $50,000 to $150,000 in perceived value for a project that might cost $3,000 to $10,000.

**Outdoor lighting** along paths, at the front entrance, and highlighting architectural features or mature trees adds both safety and visual appeal. LED landscape lighting is affordable to install and signals a well-cared-for property.

**A new front door** is another high-impact, relatively low-cost improvement. A solid wood or fiberglass front door with quality hardware runs between $2,500 and $5,000 installed. It's one of the first things buyers touch when they arrive, and it sets the tone for everything that follows.

## Finishing Your Basement: Adding Square Footage Without Adding a Foundation

In Kelowna's current market, where the average single-family home takes around 70 days to sell, anything that makes your listing stand out is valuable. A finished basement does exactly that. According to RE/MAX data, 16.1% of brokers identified finished basements as a strong selling feature, and for good reason. Any renovation that adds liveable square footage is inherently valuable because you're increasing usable space without the massive cost of a structural addition.

Basement finishing costs in Kelowna range quite a bit based on scope. According to local data, basic finishing (open living space with simple finishes) runs approximately **$45 to $65 per square foot** in the Kelowna market. A basic rec room or family room on a 600-square-foot basement could come in around $30,000 to $40,000. A full basement suite with a kitchen, bathroom, and separate entry is a bigger project, typically ranging from $100,000 to $150,000 depending on plumbing, egress windows, and code compliance.

The ROI on basement projects varies depending on what you build:

A **finished family room or home office** delivers solid return in the 50% to 70% range. It adds functional living space that families, remote workers, and anyone needing extra room will appreciate.

A **legal secondary suite** can change the financial equation entirely. Beyond the resale bump, a suite generates rental income that can offset your mortgage. In Kelowna, where secondary suite rules are regulated by the City, a legal suite in the right neighbourhood can bring in $1,200 to $1,800 per month. That rental income makes the property more attractive to buyers who are investment-minded or who want help covering their mortgage payments.

If you're considering a basement finish, keep these Kelowna-specific factors in mind. Moisture and insulation are critical in the Okanagan's four-season climate. Proper vapour barriers aren't optional. Bedrooms require compliant egress windows, and suites need fire separation and adequate ventilation. Older homes may also need electrical panel upgrades to handle the added load. Cutting corners on any of these will cost you at inspection time, or worse, create safety issues.

## Decks and Outdoor Living: Capitalizing on the Okanagan Lifestyle

Kelowna gets over 2,000 hours of sunshine per year. That's not a statistic sellers should ignore. Outdoor living space isn't a luxury here; it's an expectation. A well-designed deck or patio extends your home's usable footprint and taps directly into what makes Kelowna buyers fall in love with a property.

Deck construction costs in Canada generally range from $50 to $100 per square foot when you include both materials and labour. In the Kelowna market, expect to land somewhere in that range, with the final number depending heavily on your choice of material and design complexity.

**Pressure-treated wood** is the most affordable option, starting around $4 to $5 per square foot for materials alone. It looks great initially but requires annual staining or sealing and has a lifespan of 10 to 25 years.

**Composite decking** runs $8 to $15 per square foot for materials and has become increasingly popular in Kelowna for good reason. It resists rotting, fading, and warping, requires almost no maintenance, and can last 25 years or more. The higher upfront cost is offset by decades of savings on stain, sealant, and repairs.

For a standard 300-square-foot deck, you might budget $15,000 to $30,000 all in, depending on material choice and whether you're building from scratch or replacing an existing structure. Industry data suggests a wood deck can offer up to 52% ROI, while composite delivers around 40%. The lower percentage on composite reflects the higher initial cost, but in dollar terms, the return is often comparable because composite decks photograph better and appeal to buyers who don't want a maintenance project.

What really boosts the return on a deck investment in Kelowna is how you design it for the local lifestyle. Covered sections for year-round use, built-in seating areas for entertaining, and integration with landscaping all make the space feel intentional rather than tacked on. If your lot has a lake view or mountain sightline, orienting the deck to maximize that view is worth every extra dollar.

The City of Kelowna requires a building permit for decks with a surface more than 0.6 metres (about 2 feet) above grade, so factor permit costs and timeline into your planning.

## Which Renovations to Avoid (and How to Prioritize Your Budget)

Not every renovation makes financial sense before a sale. Being honest about which upgrades are "for you" versus "for the next buyer" can save you thousands.

**Swimming pools** are the classic money pit. They're expensive to install, costly to maintain, and divisive among buyers. Expect roughly 56% ROI at best. **Over-the-top luxury finishes** in a mid-range neighbourhood won't pay for themselves either. The general rule of thumb is to keep any single renovation project under 5% to 15% of your home's total value. **Converting a garage to living space** might seem clever, but many Kelowna buyers consider a garage essential given Okanagan winters and the need to store recreational gear. And **highly personalized design choices** like bold wallpaper or exotic paint colours can actively turn buyers off. Neutral, broadly appealing finishes sell homes faster.

If you've got a fixed budget, here's the priority order that delivers the most return:

**First, handle the dealbreakers.** Roof damage, outdated electrical panels, plumbing issues, and foundation problems will kill deals faster than anything else. A pre-listing home inspection can identify these before buyers do. **Second, invest in the kitchen**, even if it's just a modest refresh with new countertops and appliances. **Third, clean up the exterior** with landscaping, paint, and a welcoming entrance. **Fourth, update bathrooms**, starting with the ensuite. **Fifth, consider the basement** if it's unfinished and your budget allows.

Throughout all of this, remember the golden rule: don't over-renovate for your neighbourhood. A quick look at comparable recent sales in your area will tell you what the market supports.`,
