It's not the flashiest neighbourhood in the city. It's the one that actually works for everyday family life.

Glenmore sits on the north side of Kelowna, tucked into a valley between Knox Mountain to the west and Dilworth Mountain to the east. The area stretches from the busy commercial strip near Highway 97 at its southern edge all the way up through quiet residential streets toward the newer Wilden development in the north. It's centrally located without feeling like you're living on top of everything. That balance between access and calm is a huge part of why families keep landing here.

## What Makes Glenmore Kelowna Real Estate So Appealing for Families

The short answer: schools, parks, and convenience. The longer answer involves understanding how Glenmore is laid out and what daily life actually looks like here.

Most of Glenmore's residential streets are quiet and well established. You'll find a mix of homes built from the 1970s through the early 2000s, many with large yards, mature landscaping, and the kind of generous lot sizes that newer Kelowna developments don't offer. These older homes tend to have three to five bedrooms, double garages, and enough driveway space to park a boat or trailer. For families who need room to spread out, that matters.

But Glenmore isn't frozen in time. Newer infill developments and modern duplexes have been popping up, particularly in North Glenmore. You'll also find townhouse and condo options closer to the Highway 97 corridor, giving first-time buyers a way into the neighbourhood at a lower price point. The result is a community with a genuine mix of housing types and price ranges, which keeps the neighbourhood diverse in terms of age and income.

The median age of Glenmore residents sits in the early 40s, and a large percentage of households are married couples with children. That demographic reality feeds on itself: families move here because other families already live here, which keeps the schools well enrolled, the sports fields busy, and the community tight-knit.

## Schools in Glenmore: The Real Reason Families Choose This Neighbourhood

Let's be honest. For parents with school-age kids, the neighbourhood decision often comes down to one question: where are the good schools? Glenmore answers that question convincingly.

The neighbourhood is served by **School District 23 (Central Okanagan)** and offers a clear pathway from elementary through secondary:

- **Glenmore Elementary** (K-6) consistently performs well in standardized testing and is known for its strong community feel. It sits right on Glenmore Drive, walkable from most parts of the central neighbourhood.
- **Ecole Glenmore Elementary** offers **French Immersion** starting in Kindergarten, a program that's become increasingly popular with families who want their children bilingual by graduation. The French Immersion stream here feeds into Dr. Knox Middle and eventually Kelowna Secondary, where students can earn a Dual Dogwood Diploma.
- **North Glenmore Elementary** (K-6) serves the northern portion of the neighbourhood and has earned a reputation for its involved Parent Advisory Council and welcoming environment. The school has seen recent expansions to keep up with growing demand.
- **Watson Road Elementary** (K-6) rounds out the elementary options and is frequently highlighted for strong academics and active parent involvement.
- **Ecole Dr. Knox Middle School** (Grades 7-9) is the natural feeder for Glenmore's elementary schools, offering both English and French Immersion tracks. It's located right in the neighbourhood on Drysdale Boulevard.
- **Kelowna Secondary School (KSS)** serves as the high school for most Glenmore families, offering both English and French Immersion programs through Grade 12.

What sets Glenmore apart from other family neighbourhoods in Kelowna is the continuity. Your child can start French Immersion at Ecole Glenmore in Kindergarten and stay on that track all the way through graduation at KSS without ever needing to cross town. For families who value consistency and don't want to uproot kids every few years, that seamless pipeline is a genuine selling point.

Private school options are also accessible from Glenmore. Aberdeen Hall Preparatory School, which ranks among the top schools in the region with a Fraser Institute score of 8.9 out of 10, is a 15-minute drive near UBC Okanagan. Kelowna Christian School on KLO Road is similarly within reach.

## Knox Mountain: 385 Hectares of Outdoor Living at Your Doorstep

If Glenmore's schools are the practical reason families move here, Knox Mountain Park is the lifestyle reason.

**Knox Mountain Park** spans 385 hectares, making it Kelowna's largest natural area park. It rises roughly 300 metres above Okanagan Lake, and its western boundary runs right along the lakeshore. The park sits directly adjacent to Glenmore's western edge, meaning many residents can walk or bike to trailheads in minutes.

The park features 15 marked trails covering about 20 kilometres, with options ranging from easy lakeside strolls to challenging summit climbs. The **Apex Trail** is the signature hike: a moderate 2-kilometre climb with about 260 metres of elevation gain that rewards you with panoramic views of the city, the lake, and the surrounding mountains from the summit pavilion. On a clear day, you can see both the north and south reaches of Okanagan Lake.

For families with younger kids, **Paul's Tomb Trail** is a 1.5-kilometre easy walk along the water that ends at a quiet beach and picnic area. It's one of those spots that locals guard a little jealously because it feels secluded despite being minutes from downtown. The **Kathleen Lake Loop** is another family-friendly option at 2.6 kilometres with gentle terrain and a variety of ecosystems along the way.

Knox Mountain also offers an 18-hole disc golf course at its base, mountain biking trails, a designated off-leash dog park, and swimming access at Paul's Tomb beach. The park is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and during the frost-free season, you can drive partway up Knox Mountain Drive to the Crown Lookout. In spring, the hillsides explode with Arrowleaf Balsamroot, Kelowna's official flower, turning the grasslands bright yellow.

For a family living in Glenmore, Knox Mountain isn't a weekend destination you have to plan for. It's a Tuesday evening walk after dinner, a Saturday morning trail run, or a quick after-school hike with the kids. That kind of proximity to nature, right in the middle of a city, is rare.

## Glenmore Amenities: Everything a Family Needs Within Minutes

Beyond schools and Knox Mountain, Glenmore's daily convenience factor is hard to beat.

**Shopping and errands** are close. Orchard Park Shopping Centre, the largest mall in the BC Interior with over 170 stores and restaurants, sits right at Glenmore's southern edge near Highway 97. For groceries, you've got Save-On-Foods, Superstore, and Costco all within a short drive. The Glenmore Road commercial corridor has banks, dental offices, pharmacies, and medical clinics. The Kelowna Farmers' and Crafters' Market runs Wednesdays and Saturdays, offering fresh local produce and handmade goods.

**Recreation infrastructure** is expanding rapidly. The **Glenmore Recreation Park** is one of the city's most ambitious new park projects, an 11.5-hectare multi-phase development that's been taking shape since 2017. The initial phases delivered two sports fields, a fenced off-leash dog park, a cricket pitch, and parking. Phase 5, completed in 2024-2025, added tennis and pickleball courts, a fitness area, and an artificial turf field. Phase 6, slated for 2026-2027, will bring a splash park, playground, basketball courts, a skate park, and a community activity centre. When fully built out, this park will be a major recreational hub for the entire north end of the city.

The **Parkinson Recreation Centre**, located at Glenmore's southern boundary, offers a 25-metre swimming pool with a children's play pool, a whirlpool, a steam room, a full gymnasium, and a fitness room. Right next door, Apple Bowl Stadium hosts outdoor sports on full-sized fields. The **Okanagan Rail Trail** also runs through the area, providing a paved pathway that stretches from downtown Kelowna to the airport and beyond into Lake Country, perfect for family bike rides.

**Commute times** are reasonable. Downtown Kelowna is about a 10-minute drive. UBC Okanagan and Okanagan College are 15 minutes. The Kelowna International Airport is roughly 20 minutes. For families with two working parents, the central location cuts down on the daily driving that can eat up your evenings in a more spread-out community. Glenmore also sits along several Kelowna Regional Transit routes, and the flat terrain makes cycling practical for both commuting and recreation.

The **Kelowna Golf and Country Club** borders the neighbourhood's western edge, adding to the area's green, established feel. Dilworth Mountain Park on the eastern side offers additional hiking with expansive sunset views. Between Knox Mountain, Dilworth, the Rail Trail, and the new Recreation Park, Glenmore families have more outdoor options within walking distance than most Kelowna neighbourhoods can match.

## Glenmore Kelowna Real Estate: What Homes Actually Cost

Understanding what you'll pay in Glenmore requires looking at the broader Kelowna market first.

<!-- STATS -->

As of December 2025, the **benchmark price for a single-family home in Kelowna** was **$1,045,700**, according to the Association of Interior Realtors. That's down a slight 0.7% from 2024 and about 7.5% below the post-pandemic peak of $1,131,800 set in April 2022. The townhouse benchmark ended 2025 at $675,700, and condos at $470,600.

In Glenmore specifically, pricing varies significantly depending on which part of the neighbourhood you're looking at. Central Glenmore's established single-family homes, the classic three-to-four-bedroom houses on generous lots, generally list in the range of $800,000 to $1.2 million. North Glenmore trends higher, with detached homes typically ranging from $1.5 million to $2.7 million, and lakefront properties in the most premium pockets pushing well past $3 million.

For families who want into the neighbourhood at a more accessible price point, **Glenmore homes for sale** include townhouses and condos closer to the Highway 97 corridor. Condo pricing starts around $300,000, while townhouses generally fall in the $500,000 to $750,000 range.

The market in late 2025 and early 2026 has been relatively balanced. Homes in Kelowna averaged about 70 days on market in November 2025, and properties priced in line with current conditions are selling, while those priced to the highs of 2022 tend to linger. For buyers, this means you have time to make thoughtful decisions without the panic of a bidding war. For Glenmore specifically, well-priced family homes in walkable school catchments still move relatively quickly because demand from families remains steady.

## Living in Glenmore: What Day-to-Day Life Actually Feels Like

Numbers and amenity lists only tell part of the story. What actually makes Glenmore work for families is the texture of daily life.

Morning routines are simple. Many kids walk or bike to school because the elementary schools are embedded right in the residential streets, not stuck behind commercial strips or busy arterials. After school, there's no shortage of places to burn off energy: neighbourhood parks dot the area along Brandt's Creek, the new Recreation Park fields are buzzing with youth soccer and other sports, and Knox Mountain is always there for a quick adventure.

Weekend rhythms tend to involve some combination of the Farmers' Market, a Knox Mountain hike, a swim at Parkinson Rec Centre, and a grocery run that takes ten minutes instead of thirty. The neighbourhood has enough restaurants and coffee shops along the Glenmore Road corridor that you don't always need to head downtown, but downtown is close enough that it's an easy date night.

The community itself skews toward established families who've been here for years. You'll see kids playing in front yards, neighbours chatting across driveways, and a Parent Advisory Council at every school that's genuinely active. Glenmore doesn't have the Instagram appeal of a lakefront Mission neighbourhood or the newness of a master-planned community like McKinley Beach. What it has is substance: good bones, practical amenities, and the kind of neighbourhood fabric that takes decades to build.

Newer developments in North Glenmore and areas like Wilden are bringing younger families into the mix, which keeps the community evolving without losing its character. The Glenmore Recreation Park buildout over the next few years will add even more reasons for families to choose this part of the city.`,
