The Central Okanagan market wrapped up 2025 with single-family homes averaging 70 days on market, according to the Association of Interior Realtors. That's a long time for a home to sit. And in a market where the benchmark single-family home price ended the year at $1,045,700 (down 0.7% from 2024), sellers can't afford to leave money on the table by skipping presentation.

The data on staging is hard to ignore. According to the Real Estate Staging Association (RESA), staged homes spend 73% less time on the market compared to unstaged ones. Their Q1 2025 report found that for every $1 invested in professional staging, sellers saw an average return of $23.34. Even properties staged for under $1,000 delivered a 134% ROI. Those aren't hypothetical projections. Those are real transactions tracked across North America.

So how do you apply this to your Kelowna home? Whether you're tackling it yourself or hiring a pro, these are the staging tips BC sellers are using to get results. Let's break it down room by room, from DIY strategies that cost almost nothing to professional staging investments that can add tens of thousands to your sale price.

## Why Staging Your Kelowna Home for Sale Matters More Right Now

Kelowna's real estate market isn't the frenzy it was in 2021 and early 2022, when the benchmark single-family home peaked at $1,131,800 and properties were flying off the shelf with multiple offers. The market has recalibrated. In December 2025, only about 12% of listed single-family homes actually sold that month. That means roughly 88% of sellers were competing for buyer attention and coming up short.

When inventory is high and buyers have options, **staging your home for sale** becomes your competitive edge. Buyers browsing MLS listings are making snap judgments. Research shows they form opinions about a property within the first 7 to 10 seconds of seeing it, and over 90% of home searches now start online. If your listing photos show cluttered countertops, dated furniture arrangements, or empty rooms with nothing to help buyers gauge the space, you've already lost most of your audience before they ever book a showing.

Here's the thing about Kelowna specifically: you're often selling a lifestyle as much as a house. Buyers relocating from Vancouver, Alberta, or Ontario are shopping for that Okanagan dream. A well-staged home that showcases lake views, indoor-outdoor flow, and bright, airy living spaces taps into that aspiration in a way that an unstaged property simply can't.

According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), 82% of buyers' agents say staging makes it easier for buyers to visualize a property as their future home. In a market where buyers are cautious and the average discount from list price hovers around 3%, staging helps you hold your asking price.

## The Rooms That Matter Most (And Where to Skip)

Not every room needs to be staged, and spreading your effort too thin is one of the most common mistakes sellers make. The research is clear on where to focus your energy and budget.

**Living room.** This is the number one priority for buyers, with NAR data showing 93% of agents ranking it as the most important space to stage. It sets the tone for the entire home. Think clean sightlines, a defined seating area, and enough furniture to show scale without crowding the room. If your living room has views of the lake or surrounding hills (a major selling point in areas like the Lower Mission, Upper Mission, or West Kelowna), make sure nothing is blocking those windows.

**Primary bedroom.** Ranked second by 84% of agents. Buyers want to walk in and immediately feel calm and comfortable. Fresh, neutral bedding, matching nightstands, and minimal clutter on surfaces go a long way. Remove the TV if it dominates the room. Add a throw blanket and a few decorative pillows to soften the space.

**Kitchen.** The third most impactful room at 76%. You don't need to renovate your kitchen to stage it well. Clear everything off the counters except one or two intentional items (a wooden cutting board with a plant, a cookbook, a simple fruit bowl). Clean the appliances until they shine. If your cabinet hardware is dated, swapping it out for modern pulls costs under $200 and makes a noticeable difference.

**Where to skip.** Home offices and spare bedrooms rank at the bottom for staging impact. If you're working with a limited budget, keep these rooms clean and tidy but don't invest in rented furniture or professional design for them. A spare room with a simple desk and chair, or even just a clean, empty space with good lighting, is perfectly fine.

## DIY Home Staging Ideas That Cost Almost Nothing

You don't need to hire a professional stager to make a meaningful difference. Some of the highest-impact **home staging ideas** are things you can do yourself over a weekend. Here's where to start.

**Declutter ruthlessly.** This is the single most important thing you can do, and it's free. The goal is functional minimalism. Every room should feel spacious, clean, and purposeful. Pack away at least 30% of your belongings before listing. Family photos, collections, fridge magnets, kids' artwork on the walls, the overflow of shoes by the front door; all of it needs to go into storage. You're not erasing your personality because you don't like your home. You're creating a blank canvas so buyers can project their own life into the space.

**Deep clean everything.** This sounds obvious, but the bar is higher than you think. We're talking baseboards, inside window tracks, grout lines, light switch plates, exhaust fan covers. Hire a professional cleaning service for a one-time deep clean if you can. A spotless home signals to buyers that the property has been well maintained, which reduces the mental "risk" they associate with making an offer.

**Fix the small stuff.** Leaky faucets, squeaky doors, burned-out lightbulbs, scuffed baseboards, cracked outlet covers. Buyers notice these things during showings and mentally start tallying up repair costs. A Saturday spent addressing minor maintenance issues can prevent buyers from negotiating $5,000 or $10,000 off your asking price.

**Neutralize your colour palette.** If you've got bold accent walls or highly personal colour choices, consider repainting in warm neutrals. Soft whites, light greys, warm greiges. A fresh coat of paint is one of the highest-ROI improvements you can make before selling, with real estate agents estimating it adds over $7,500 in perceived value on average. In Kelowna, where natural light is abundant for much of the year, lighter walls amplify that brightness and make rooms feel larger.

**Upgrade your lighting.** Replace any dated or dim light fixtures with clean, modern options. Swap out warm yellow bulbs for bright white LED bulbs (around 4000K). Open every blind and curtain for showings. Light is one of the most underrated factors in how buyers perceive a home's condition and size.

**Add life with greenery.** A few well-placed plants, a vase of fresh flowers on the dining table, or a small herb arrangement on the kitchen counter adds warmth without clutter. Just don't go overboard. Two or three plants per room is the sweet spot.

## Professional Staging in Kelowna: What It Costs and When It's Worth It

If you're selling a property above the $800,000 range (which includes most single-family homes in Kelowna), professional staging is worth serious consideration. The data consistently shows that higher-value properties see incrementally better staging ROI, likely because buyers at those price points place a premium on presentation quality.

Here's what you can expect to pay in the Kelowna market, based on local staging companies:

- **Consultation only:** Around $300 for a two-hour walkthrough with a designer who provides a written plan using your existing furniture and decor. This is the sweet spot for sellers who are willing to do the work themselves but want expert guidance on what to change.
- **Partial staging (key rooms):** Typically $1,500 to $3,000 per month for staging the living room, kitchen, primary bedroom, and possibly the dining area. This includes furniture rental, delivery, setup, and removal.
- **Full vacant home staging:** Ranges from $2,000 to $6,000 or more per month depending on the size of the property and the quality of furnishings. This is essential if you're selling an empty home, because vacant properties are notoriously difficult for buyers to connect with emotionally.

For a million-dollar home in Kelowna, even a $3,000 staging investment represents less than 0.3% of the sale price. If staging helps you sell just 1% closer to your asking price, that's a $10,000 return on a $3,000 investment. The math is straightforward.

**When to go professional:** If your home is vacant, if you've already been on the market for 30+ days without offers, if your property is in the luxury segment, or if you simply don't have the eye for layout and design. RESA's research suggests that properties staged after 30 days on market rarely recover full pricing power, so treat staging as a proactive strategy, not a last resort.

**When DIY is fine:** If you're already living in a well-furnished, relatively modern home and you're willing to declutter aggressively and follow a stager's consultation plan. Many occupied homes just need editing, not a complete overhaul.

## Curb Appeal: How to Stage the Outside of Your Kelowna Home

Most sellers focus entirely on interior staging and forget that the first impression happens at the curb. Research published in The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics found that homes with strong curb appeal sell for an average of **7% more** than comparable homes in the same neighbourhood. On a $1 million Kelowna home, that's a $70,000 difference.

The curb appeal premium actually increases in slower markets. When buyers have more choices, they gravitate toward homes that look polished and well-maintained from the outside. With Kelowna sitting in buyer's market conditions through much of 2025, the exterior of your home deserves just as much attention as the interior.

Here are the highest-ROI exterior improvements, based on data from the 2025 Cost vs. Value Report:

**Garage door replacement** ranks as the number one ROI project in the country, returning roughly 194% to 268% of its cost. A new insulated garage door costs between $2,000 and $4,500 and can add $8,000 to $12,000 in resale value. Given that garage doors often make up 30% to 40% of a home's front face, this upgrade has an outsized visual impact.

**Front entry door replacement** (steel or fibreglass) returns approximately 188% to 216% of its cost. A new door with modern hardware and clean lines immediately signals quality to buyers walking up to the home.

**Landscaping** delivers close to 100% ROI on average. Basic yard care, fresh mulch, trimmed shrubs, and seasonal flowers are the minimum. Power-wash the driveway, walkways, and any retaining walls. In Kelowna, where outdoor living is a major selling point, making sure your yard looks lush and intentional is critical. If you have a deck or patio, stage it with outdoor furniture to help buyers envision summer evenings by the lake.

**Don't forget the details.** Clean or replace your house numbers. Update your exterior light fixtures. Paint or stain the front porch if it's looking worn. Make sure the mailbox isn't rusted. These five-minute fixes cost almost nothing but contribute to the overall impression of a cared-for property.

## Virtual Staging: A Budget-Friendly Alternative for Empty Kelowna Homes

Virtual staging has become increasingly popular, especially for vacant properties and condo listings where physical staging costs can eat into a tighter margin. The process involves digitally furnishing listing photos so buyers can see the potential of empty rooms, typically costing $50 to $150 per photo. For a listing needing 6 to 8 photos virtually staged, you're looking at $300 to $1,200 total with no monthly rental fees.

In Kelowna's condo market, where units averaged 76 days on market in December 2025, anything that helps your listing stand out is worth the investment. The caveat: virtual staging only works for online presentation. When buyers show up in person to an empty home, the gap between photos and reality can be jarring. The best approach is to combine virtual staging for your MLS photos with a few physical touches: a clean area rug in the living room, a simple vase on the kitchen island, and towels in the bathroom to bridge that gap.

## A Room-by-Room Staging Checklist for Kelowna Sellers

Before your listing goes live, walk through your home with fresh eyes and check each space against these priorities.

**Entryway:** Clean the front door, add a new welcome mat, and make sure the lighting is bright. This is where buyers transition from curb to interior.

**Living room:** Define a clear conversation area. Remove at least one piece of furniture if the room feels crowded. Add throw pillows in neutral tones. Style the coffee table with one or two items.

**Kitchen:** Clear all counters. Store small appliances. Clean the inside of the oven and microwave (buyers open everything). Add a fresh hand towel near the sink.

**Primary bedroom:** Invest in a new duvet cover and pillow shams in white or soft neutrals. Clear nightstands down to a lamp and one small item.

**Bathrooms:** New white towels, folded neatly. Clear personal products off every surface. Replace stained shower curtains. Fix any mouldy caulking.

**Outdoor spaces:** Stage the deck or patio with furniture set up for entertaining. If you have a view, make sure there's a seating arrangement that faces it. Power-wash everything.

The goal across every room is the same: **sell your home for more money** by helping buyers see themselves living there. Every personal item you remove, every surface you clean, and every space you define brings a buyer one step closer to making an offer.`,
