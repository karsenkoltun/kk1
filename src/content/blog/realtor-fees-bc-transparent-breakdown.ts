  content: `If you're planning to sell your home in British Columbia, one of the first questions you'll probably ask is: what are **realtor fees in BC**, and how much will they actually cost me? It's a fair question, and one that deserves a straight answer. The problem is that most of the information out there is either vague, buried in fine print, or wrapped in so much industry jargon that you walk away more confused than when you started.

Here's the thing. There is no standard **real estate commission in BC**. Canada's Competition Act specifically prohibits real estate associations from setting or enforcing fixed commission rates. Every agent sets their own fees, and every listing agreement is negotiable. That said, certain commission structures are far more common than others, and once you understand how the math works, the whole picture becomes a lot less intimidating.

Let's break it all down, dollar by dollar.

## How Real Estate Commission Works in BC

The most common commission structure you'll see in British Columbia is a tiered percentage model. Instead of one flat rate on the entire sale price, your agent charges a higher percentage on the first portion and a lower percentage on the rest.

A typical structure looks something like this: **7% on the first $100,000** of the sale price, and **3% on the remaining balance**. Some brokerages use slightly different splits, like 6% and 3%, or 7% and 2.5%, but the 7/3 model is the one you'll encounter most frequently in the Okanagan and across much of the province.

<!-- STATS -->

Let's put real numbers to this. Say you're selling a home in Kelowna for $1,045,000, which was right around the benchmark price for a single-family home in the Central Okanagan at the end of 2025, according to the Association of Interior Realtors.

Here's how the commission calculation would look:

- 7% on the first $100,000 = $7,000
- 3% on the remaining $945,000 = $28,350
- **Total commission: $35,350**

Now add 5% GST on top of that (because real estate brokerage services are subject to Goods and Services Tax in BC), and you're looking at **$37,117.50** in total commission costs.

That's a significant number, and it's important to understand exactly where that money goes.

## Where Does Your Commission Actually Go?

One of the biggest misconceptions about **how much realtors charge** is that your listing agent pockets the entire fee. They don't. Not even close.

That total commission gets split between two brokerages: the one representing you as the seller, and the one representing the buyer. The split is typically close to 50/50, though the seller's brokerage often retains a slightly larger share to account for the cost of listing and marketing the property.

Using our $1,045,000 example with a $35,350 commission (before GST), a rough split might look like this:

- Seller's brokerage: approximately $18,000 to $19,000
- Buyer's brokerage: approximately $16,000 to $17,000

But here's the part most people don't realize. Your agent doesn't keep that full brokerage share either. Each brokerage takes a percentage off the top to cover office expenses, technology, administration, and insurance. What your individual agent takes home after the brokerage split, taxes, and business expenses is considerably less than what the total commission number suggests.

This cooperative compensation model is what motivates the entire network of buyer's agents across BC to show your home to their clients. As of early 2025, British Columbia had roughly 29,400 licensed real estate professionals working with around 1,545 brokerages. When you list your home with a commission that includes a buyer's agent share, you're tapping into that entire network. It's not just your agent working for you; it's thousands of agents potentially bringing qualified buyers through your door.

## What Services Are Included in Realtor Commission in Kelowna

Commission isn't just a fee for unlocking a door and putting a sign on your lawn. A good agent earns their **realtor commission in Kelowna** (or anywhere in BC) by providing a comprehensive suite of services that directly impact how quickly your home sells and for how much.

Here's what you should expect your commission to cover:

**Pricing strategy and market analysis.** Your agent should provide a detailed comparative market analysis using recent sales data, active listings, and expired listings to price your home competitively. In a market like Kelowna's, where the benchmark single-family home price ended 2025 at $1,045,700 but inventory sat at roughly 8 months of supply for single-family homes, pricing strategy matters enormously. Price too high and your home sits. Price right and you attract serious offers.

**Professional photography and marketing.** This includes high-resolution photos, virtual tours, drone footage, floor plans, and feature sheets. Your agent should also be running targeted digital advertising campaigns, MLS syndication, and social media promotion. The days of sticking a listing on MLS and waiting for the phone to ring are long gone.

**Showings, open houses, and buyer screening.** Your agent coordinates all showing requests, hosts open houses, and screens potential buyers to make sure they're qualified and serious.

**Negotiation.** This is where a skilled agent really earns their fee. Negotiating the sale price, navigating multiple offers, handling subjects like financing and inspection, and keeping the deal together through to completion are all part of the job.

**Transaction management.** From accepted offer to completion day, there's a mountain of paperwork, deadlines, and coordination with lawyers, mortgage brokers, home inspectors, and appraisers. Your agent manages all of it.

Before you sign a listing agreement, have a detailed conversation with your agent about exactly which services are included. The BC Financial Services Authority (BCFSA), which regulates real estate professionals in the province, requires that service agreements clearly outline the commission rate, contract duration, and the services your agent will provide. If something isn't written down, don't assume it's included.

## Are Realtor Fees Negotiable in BC?

Yes. Full stop.

Commission rates in BC are always negotiable. The BCFSA confirms this on their consumer resources page, and Canada's Competition Act makes it illegal for any real estate board or association to fix or enforce a standard rate. You have every right to discuss commission with your agent and negotiate a structure that works for both of you.

That said, negotiation is a two-way street. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you ask your agent to cut their rate.

**Lower commission often means reduced services.** If an agent agrees to a significantly lower fee, ask what's being taken off the table. Are you losing professional photography? Paid advertising? A dedicated marketing plan? The cheapest option isn't always the best value.

**The buyer's agent share matters.** If you reduce the overall commission and the buyer's agent share drops as a result, some buyer's agents may be less motivated to show your property. That's not how it should work in a perfect world, but it's a reality of how compensation structures influence behaviour. In a buyer's market like Kelowna's current one, where only about 12% to 13% of listed homes were selling each month at the end of 2025, you want every possible advantage.

**Flat-fee and discount models exist.** Some brokerages in BC offer flat-fee listing services or reduced commission packages. These can work well for sellers who are comfortable handling more of the process themselves, but they typically come with fewer services. You might save on commission but spend more time and effort managing the sale.

**Think about value, not just cost.** A skilled agent who negotiates your sale price up by $20,000 or prevents a deal from falling apart is worth their commission many times over. The question isn't just "how much do realtors charge" but "what return am I getting on this investment?"

## Buyer Agent Fees: What Buyers Need to Know

If you're on the buying side of a transaction in BC, you might be wondering whether you'll need to pay your own agent. In most cases, the answer is no. The seller typically pays the commission for both the listing agent and the buyer's agent from the sale proceeds at closing.

However, the landscape around buyer agent compensation is evolving. The BCFSA has been actively exploring changes to increase transparency and protect consumers. In late 2025, BCFSA released a discussion paper called "Strengthening Confidence in Real Estate Services" that proposed several notable changes, including the possibility of requiring mandatory buyer service agreements and restricting the practice of "double ending," where a listing brokerage keeps the full commission when the buyer is unrepresented.

What this means for you as a buyer right now is simple: before you start seriously looking at homes, have an upfront conversation with your buyer's agent about how they're compensated. Your agent is required by BCFSA regulations to disclose how much they'll receive for representing you. This is done through a Disclosure of Remuneration form, which converts the percentage into a dollar amount so you can see exactly what's being paid.

If you sign a buyer's agency agreement and the seller of a property you want to purchase isn't offering enough commission to cover your agent's fee, you may be responsible for making up the difference. This is relatively uncommon in BC right now, but it's something to discuss with your agent before you start touring homes.

## The Full Cost of Selling: Beyond Realtor Fees

Real estate commission is the largest **selling cost in BC**, but it's not the only one. Here's what else you should budget for when calculating your net proceeds from a sale.

**Legal fees.** You'll need a lawyer or notary to handle the conveyance of your sale. In BC, legal fees for a straightforward residential sale typically range from **$800 to $1,500**, plus GST and PST. A notary is usually the more economical option for simple transactions, while a lawyer may be worth the extra cost for anything complicated.

**Mortgage discharge fees.** If you're paying off your mortgage at closing, your lender will charge a discharge fee, typically between **$200 and $350**. If you're breaking a fixed-rate mortgage before the end of its term, prepayment penalties can add thousands of dollars to your costs. Check with your lender well before listing.

**Home preparation costs.** Professional cleaning, minor repairs, landscaping, and staging all add up. Professional staging in the Okanagan can run anywhere from **$2,000 to $5,000** depending on the scope. Some agents include staging in their commission; many don't.

**Property taxes and strata fees.** These are prorated to the closing date. If you've prepaid your property taxes for the year and the sale closes mid-year, you'll receive a credit. If you haven't paid them, the outstanding amount comes off your proceeds.

**GST on commission and legal fees.** Don't forget the 5% GST that applies to your real estate commission and the 5% GST plus 7% PST that apply to legal fees. On a commission of $35,350, that GST alone is $1,767.50.

For a home selling at around $1,045,000 in Kelowna, your total selling costs (commission, legal fees, mortgage discharge, staging, and taxes on those fees) could realistically land somewhere between **$40,000 and $50,000**. That's a number worth knowing before you start planning what you'll walk away with.

## How to Choose the Right Agent (It's Not Just About the Lowest Fee)

Finding the right agent is about more than comparing commission rates. Here are the questions that actually matter:

**How well do they know the local market?** An agent who understands Kelowna's specific neighbourhoods, pricing trends, and buyer demographics will market and price your home more effectively than someone working from a template. With 3,640 residential sales across Kelowna in 2025 and a market where motivated, well-priced homes sell while overpriced ones sit for months, local expertise is everything.

**What's their marketing plan?** Ask to see examples of past listings. Look at the quality of photography, the reach of their digital advertising, and whether they have a genuine strategy or just a listing on MLS.

**What's their track record?** Ask for their list-to-sell ratio, average days on market, and how many transactions they've completed in the past year. Numbers don't lie.

**Do they communicate well?** Selling a home is stressful. You want an agent who responds quickly, explains things clearly, and keeps you informed throughout the process.

**Is their commission transparent?** A good agent will walk you through their fee structure without hesitation, explain exactly what services are included, and make sure you understand the listing agreement before you sign. If an agent is cagey about their commission or rushes you past the details, that's a red flag.`,
