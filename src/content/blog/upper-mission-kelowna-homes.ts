  content: `Upper Mission Kelowna homes sit high above the city on the south-facing hillside, and they earn every bit of their reputation. This is one of those neighbourhoods where you pull into someone's driveway, look over your shoulder, and realize you're staring at an unbroken panorama stretching from Peachland to West Kelowna across the full expanse of Okanagan Lake. It's the kind of view that sells houses before you even step inside.

But Upper Mission isn't just about views. It's a collection of distinct sub-neighbourhoods, each with its own character, price point, and lifestyle. Crawford Estates, Westpointe, Southridge, Kettle Valley, Trestle Ridge, Iron Horse. Some are gated. Some are master-planned. Some are sprawling estate lots where your nearest neighbour is a row of Pinot Noir vines. Understanding which pocket of Upper Mission fits your life (and your budget) is the difference between buying a house and finding the right home.

## What Makes Upper Mission Real Estate Different from the Rest of Kelowna

The most obvious thing is elevation. Upper Mission climbs from roughly Barnaby Road up into the hills east of Okanagan Lake, and that altitude is what creates those sweeping lake and city views that define the area. But elevation also means something practical: you're above the valley floor, which brings cooler summer evenings, less traffic noise, and a real sense of separation from the bustle of Highway 97 and the downtown core. You're only about 15 minutes from downtown Kelowna, but it feels further.

The housing stock here skews newer than many other Kelowna neighbourhoods. Most homes were built from the early 2000s onward, with ongoing construction happening in Kettle Valley's Legacy Neighbourhood and newer phases of Trestle Ridge. You won't find many 1970s ranchers up here. Instead, expect contemporary builds, modern craftsman-style homes, and custom estates with 3,000 to 5,500+ square feet of living space. Walk-out basements are common given the sloped terrain, and many homes are designed specifically to maximize those south and west-facing lake views with walls of windows and expansive decks.

Lot sizes vary dramatically depending on which sub-neighbourhood you're in. In Kettle Valley's village-style streets, you'll find well-designed lots in the 5,000 to 7,000 square foot range. Over in Crawford Estates, lots regularly exceed a quarter acre, and some push past half an acre. At The Edge, a gated community within Trestle Ridge, lots start at over half an acre with 100-foot building frontages designed for true estate-scale homes.

## Price Brackets: What Upper Mission Homes Actually Cost

Upper Mission covers a wider price range than people expect. It's known as a luxury neighbourhood, and there's plenty of that, but it's not exclusively multi-million dollar estates.

<!-- STATS -->

**Entry level ($500,000 to $900,000):** This is where you'll find newer condo and townhome developments like Ascent by Highstreet, located near Mission Village at The Ponds. These are well-built, modern units with community amenities including a gym, games area, and patio space. Two-bedroom condos in this development start in the low $500,000s, offering a more attainable way into the neighbourhood. You'll also find older townhomes and smaller homes at the lower end of this range.

**Mid-range ($900,000 to $1,500,000):** This is the sweet spot for families looking at three to four-bedroom detached homes with good square footage. Many of these are in Kettle Valley or the more established sections of Upper Mission. You'll typically get 2,000 to 3,000 square feet, a double garage, and solid lake or valley views. As of early 2026, the median list price for a single-family home in Upper Mission sits around **$1,300,000**, according to MLS data compiled by local brokerages.

**Luxury ($1,500,000 to $3,000,000+):** This is where Upper Mission really earns its reputation. Custom homes in Crawford Estates, the upper reaches of Trestle Ridge, or exclusive streets along Upper Mission Drive regularly list between $1.5 million and $3.3 million. You're looking at 3,500 to 5,500 square feet, resort-style backyards with pools, triple garages, and views that stretch the full width of the lake. A few truly exceptional properties, particularly those with acreage or waterfront along Lakeshore Road at the base of the Upper Mission, have listed north of $5 million.

For context, the citywide benchmark price for a single-family home in the Central Okanagan was approximately **$1,045,000** as of mid-2025, according to the Association of Interior Realtors. Upper Mission consistently trades well above that average, reflecting the neighbourhood's premium positioning.

## Gated Communities and Notable Subdivisions in Upper Mission

One feature that sets Upper Mission apart from most Kelowna neighbourhoods is its concentration of gated and exclusive communities. If privacy and security rank high on your list, you have options here that don't really exist elsewhere in the city.

**Iron Horse Estates** is a 72-home gated community located within walking distance of Chute Lake Elementary School. It's fully sold out now, but resale properties come up periodically and are highly sought after. Homes here feature large lots, high-end finishes, and the kind of quiet, family-friendly streets where kids ride bikes without parents worrying about through traffic.

**The Edge at Trestle Ridge** is a newer gated community offering 17 oversized lots, each exceeding half an acre. With 100-foot building frontages and unobstructed panoramic views, these are designed for buyers who want to build a custom estate without compromise. Lots originally started around $690,000, and the homes being built on them are pushing well past $2 million.

**Tuscany Lane** is another prestigious gated enclave featuring luxury estate homes with sweeping, unobstructed views of Okanagan Lake, the city, and the valley beyond.

**Kettle Valley** deserves its own section (see below), but it's worth noting that while it isn't gated, its master-planned design and village-centre layout create a strong sense of community that many residents value just as highly as a gate.

## Kettle Valley: A Neighbourhood Within a Neighbourhood

You can't write about Upper Mission real estate without spending real time on Kettle Valley. Founded in 1996, Kettle Valley is an **award-winning master-planned community** built on neo-traditional design principles. That means walkable streetscapes, tree-lined boulevards, plentiful parks, and a genuine village centre with shops and services. It's been called Canada's Best Community, and it's one of those rare developments that actually lives up to its marketing.

The Village Centre is the heart of Kettle Valley and includes a coffee shop, pizza restaurant (Papito's, a neighbourhood favourite), a family restaurant, a day spa, dental and chiropractic offices, and a small grocery store. You can genuinely walk from your front door to grab a coffee or pick up dinner without getting in your car. That sounds simple, but it's surprisingly rare in Kelowna's suburban landscape.

For families, Kettle Valley is particularly appealing. **Chute Lake Elementary School** (K-7) opened in 2009 right within the community, consistently achieving above-average academic results. **Canyon Falls Middle School** (grades 6-8) opened in 2019 on Frost Road, purpose-built for modern, collaborative learning. And for high school, students attend **Okanagan Mission Secondary** in the Lower Mission, which ranks among the top public secondary schools in Kelowna.

The community spirit here is genuine. Residents organize annual events like the Kettle Valley Garage Sale (running for more than 19 years), holiday light-up contests, and Parks Alive concerts. Halloween in Kettle Valley is legendary, with streets that go all out with decorations and hundreds of trick-or-treaters.

The newest phase of development, the **Legacy Neighbourhood**, was approved by Kelowna City Council in 2023. It's the final 14.1-acre parcel in the original master plan and will deliver 99 new homes (a mix of single-family, duplex, and townhomes) along with nearly 50% of the site dedicated to public parkland, including a permanent sports field. This completes the Kettle Valley story at just under the originally approved 1,028-unit threshold.

## Schools, Trails, and Lifestyle in Upper Mission Kelowna

**Schools** are a major draw for families considering Upper Mission. The neighbourhood falls within **School District 23 (Central Okanagan)**, with catchment schools including:

- Anne McClymont Elementary (K-7)
- Chute Lake Elementary (K-7, located in Kettle Valley)
- Dorothea Walker Elementary (grades 3-5, with French Immersion starting at grade 3)
- Canyon Falls Middle School (grades 6-8)
- Okanagan Mission Secondary (grades 9-12)

For French Immersion, students can attend Dorothea Walker Elementary (grades 3-6), then KLO Middle School (grades 7-9), and Kelowna Secondary (grades 10-12). Several private preschool programs operate in the area as well.

**Outdoor recreation** is arguably Upper Mission's strongest selling point beyond the views. The neighbourhood is bordered by an incredible network of trails and parks. **Kuipers Peak Mountain Park** offers challenging hikes with panoramic views. **Johns Family Nature Conservancy Regional Park** covers more than 400 hectares of protected land perched above the city. **Crawford Falls** is a popular destination, especially in spring. And the rebuilt **Kettle Valley Railway Trail** and the **Myra Canyon Trestles** are just further up the mountain, offering some of the most scenic cycling and hiking in all of British Columbia.

For wine lovers, you don't have to go far. **Summerhill Pyramid Winery**, one of the Okanagan's most iconic wineries (and its famous white pyramid), is right within the Upper Mission area along Chute Lake Road. **St. Hubertus & Oak Bay Estate Winery** is also nearby, with acres of vineyard covering the hillside.

And when summer hits, Okanagan Lake is a short drive downhill. Bertram Creek Regional Park and Cedar Creek Park both offer public beach access, boat launches, and picnic areas.

## What the Upper Mission Market Looks Like Right Now

The Central Okanagan real estate market started 2026 on the slower side, which is typical for January. According to the Association of Interior Realtors, **226 units sold** across the Central Okanagan in January 2026, with approximately **3,109 active listings** on the market. That works out to roughly **13.8 months of supply**, which puts the region firmly in buyer's market territory.

For Upper Mission specifically, the dynamics are a bit different than the broader market. Premium neighbourhoods with limited supply and strong demand tend to hold their values more consistently. As of recent MLS data, there are roughly **130+ active listings** in Upper Mission across all property types, with an average price per square foot around **$628** and average days on market around **75 days**. Well-priced homes with strong views and quality finishes still attract serious attention. Overpriced listings sit.

The broader trend is worth noting: after three consecutive years of softening since the 2022 peak, the Okanagan market is showing early signs of stabilization and cautious recovery heading into 2026. Interest rates have come down from their 2023 highs, buyer confidence is slowly returning, and the sales-to-new-listings ratio has been hovering in the 40 to 45% range, indicating balanced conditions. For buyers eyeing Upper Mission, this creates a window that hasn't existed in years: more inventory to choose from, more room to negotiate, and borrowing costs that are meaningfully lower than they were 18 months ago.

## Is Upper Mission Right for You?

Upper Mission isn't for everyone. If you want a quick walk to downtown restaurants or a condo with zero maintenance, Lower Mission or downtown Kelowna might suit you better. If budget is the primary concern, Rutland offers significantly more home for your dollar.

But if you're looking for a neighbourhood where the quality of construction is high, the views are genuinely spectacular, the schools are excellent, and you can step out your back door onto a hiking trail, Upper Mission is hard to beat. It's a neighbourhood that rewards you every single morning when you look out the window. And that's not something you can say about many places.`,
