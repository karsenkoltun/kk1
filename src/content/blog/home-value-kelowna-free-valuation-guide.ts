  content: `If you've been wondering about your **home value in Kelowna**, you're not alone. It's one of the most common questions homeowners ask, and it's also one of the trickiest to answer well. The number on your BC Assessment notice, the estimate from an online calculator, and the price a buyer would actually pay for your home can be three very different figures. Understanding the gap between them is the first step toward making smart decisions about selling, refinancing, or simply knowing where you stand.

Kelowna's housing market has shifted significantly over the past few years. The benchmark price for a single-family home in the Central Okanagan ended 2025 at $1,045,700, down a slight 0.7% from the year prior and about 7.5% below the post-pandemic peak of $1.13 million set in April 2022. Townhomes sat at a benchmark of $675,700, while condos came in around $470,600. Those are useful signposts, but they don't tell you what your specific property is worth. That requires a closer look.

This guide walks you through every way to determine your **Kelowna home valuation**, explains what each method actually measures, and shows you which factors push your property's value up or down.

## BC Assessment vs. Market Value: Why They're Not the Same Thing

Every January, BC Assessment mails property owners a notice with their home's assessed value. It's a number that carries real weight because it directly determines your property taxes. But here's the critical distinction most homeowners miss: **your BC Assessment is not your market value**.

BC Assessment determines property values based on the estimated market value as of July 1 of the previous year. So the 2026 assessment you receive in January 2026 reflects what your home would have sold for on July 1, 2025. By the time you're reading that notice, the real market could have shifted in either direction.

The assessment process works like this. BC Assessment's professional appraisers review sales data, building permits, and neighbourhood trends across the province. They evaluate factors like your property's location, lot size, the age and condition of your home, and any features that set it apart. For the 2025 assessment cycle, most BC homeowners saw modest changes in the range of negative 5% to positive 5%, reflecting a market that has generally stabilized for two consecutive years.

Here's where it gets practical. If your neighbour sold their comparable home in September for $975,000 and your BC Assessment says $940,000, that doesn't mean your home is only worth $940,000. It means BC Assessment's snapshot was taken earlier, before that sale influenced the data. Conversely, if the market softened after July 1, your assessment might actually be higher than what you'd get today.

Your assessed value matters for one thing above all else: property taxes. In Kelowna, the 2025 municipal tax increase was 4.34%, bringing the municipal portion of property taxes to approximately $2,592 for an average residential property assessed at $973,000. That works out to about $108 more per year, or roughly $9 per month. But when it comes to actually selling your home or understanding **what your house is worth**, you need a more current and nuanced picture.

You can look up your property's BC Assessment anytime at bcassessment.ca. It's public information. Compare it to nearby properties, check recent sales in your area, and use it as a starting point, not a final answer.

## What Is a Comparative Market Analysis (And Why It's the Gold Standard)

A **Comparative Market Analysis**, or CMA, is the most reliable way to determine your home's current market value. It's what real estate agents use to help sellers set a listing price and buyers make competitive offers. Unlike a BC Assessment, a CMA reflects what's happening in the market right now, not six or twelve months ago.

Here's how it works. Your agent pulls recent sales of homes similar to yours, typically from the past three to six months, within the same neighbourhood or a comparable area. These are called "comps." A quality CMA looks at three to ten comparable properties and evaluates them against your home across several dimensions: square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, age of the home, condition, upgrades, and location specifics like proximity to the lake, schools, or major roads.

No two homes are identical, so adjustments are key. If a comp sold for $1,050,000 but had a recently renovated kitchen and yours doesn't, the agent might subtract $20,000 to $30,000 from that comp's price. If your home has a legal secondary suite and the comp doesn't, that adds value. A skilled agent accounts for these differences to arrive at a realistic price range for your property.

A CMA also examines active listings (what you're competing against), pending sales (what's under contract but hasn't closed yet), and expired listings (homes that didn't sell, often because they were overpriced). This full picture helps you understand not just what homes have sold for, but what the current competition looks like.

The difference between a CMA and a formal appraisal is important. An appraisal is conducted by a licensed appraiser, typically ordered by a mortgage lender to verify a property's value before approving financing. It's a more formal process with standardized methodology. A CMA is prepared by a real estate agent and is generally offered as a complimentary service to potential sellers. Both are valuable, but a CMA is usually the first step when you're trying to answer the question, "how much is my home worth?"

In Kelowna's current buyer's market, where the list-to-sell ratio for single-family homes hovered around 12% at the end of 2025, pricing accurately from the start is more important than ever. Overpricing by even 5% can mean your home sits for weeks or months while better-priced listings sell around it.

## Key Factors That Affect Your Kelowna Property Value

Understanding **what your house is worth** requires knowing the specific factors that drive value in the Central Okanagan. Some of these apply anywhere in Canada. Others are uniquely Kelowna.

**Location within the city** is the single biggest factor. A 2,000-square-foot home in Lower Mission might be worth $300,000 to $500,000 more than an identical home in Rutland, purely based on proximity to the lake, walkability, and neighbourhood prestige. Glenmore, Upper Mission, and McKinley Beach all command premium prices for different reasons, whether it's family-friendly amenities, panoramic views, or newer master-planned infrastructure.

**Lot size and usability** matter more in the Okanagan than in many other markets. A flat, south-facing lot with lake views will always outperform a steep, north-facing lot of the same size. Corner lots, lots backing onto green space, and properties with mature landscaping all carry premiums.

**The condition and age of major systems** can significantly move the needle. A roof that's 25 years old, an aging furnace, or original single-pane windows will make buyers nervous and lower offers. Conversely, a home with a newer roof, updated electrical panel, high-efficiency HVAC, and modern plumbing reassures buyers and supports a higher price.

**Legal secondary suites and rental potential** have become increasingly valuable. With Kelowna's housing affordability challenges, a legal basement suite generating $1,200 to $1,800 per month in rental income makes a property significantly more attractive to both owner-occupants and investors.

**Outdoor living space** carries outsized weight in a market defined by its climate. A well-designed deck, hot tub, outdoor kitchen, or landscaped yard that takes advantage of the Okanagan's warm summers adds real value. Pools can be polarizing, but in the right neighbourhood and price range, they're a genuine asset.

**Wildfire risk and FireSmart compliance** are factors that didn't matter much a decade ago but now influence buyer decisions and insurance costs. Properties that have implemented FireSmart landscaping and building practices can be easier to sell and less expensive to insure.

**Current market conditions** provide the backdrop for everything else. With approximately 8 months of inventory for single-family homes in the Central Okanagan as of mid-2025, well above the balanced market threshold of about 4 months, sellers need to be realistic about pricing. Homes that are priced right are still selling, but overpriced properties are sitting.

## Why Online Home Value Estimates Can Mislead You

It's tempting to punch your address into an online home value estimator and take that number at face value. Plenty of websites offer instant estimates of your **Kelowna property assessment** or market value. Some are better than others, but none should be your sole source of truth.

These tools use algorithms that pull from public records, tax assessments, and whatever sales data they can access. The problem is that they can't see inside your home. They don't know you spent $60,000 renovating your kitchen last year, or that your basement floods every spring, or that your lake view was recently blocked by a new development.

In Kelowna, where neighbourhoods vary dramatically block by block, these tools are especially unreliable. The algorithm might lump your quiet cul-de-sac in with a busy arterial road two streets over, or compare your 1970s rancher to a 2019 infill build on the same street. The resulting estimate could be off by tens of thousands of dollars.

Use online estimates as a rough starting point, not a decision-making tool. Before selling, refinancing, or leveraging your home's equity, you need a professional **Kelowna home valuation** that accounts for the specifics of your property.

## How to Get a Free Home Evaluation in Kelowna

Getting a **free home evaluation in Kelowna** is straightforward. Most real estate agents, including our team at Royal LePage Kelowna, offer complimentary CMAs to homeowners who are curious about their property's value. You don't need to be actively planning to sell.

Here's what the process typically looks like. You reach out and share your address and some basic details about your home. Your agent reviews public records, recent comparable sales, active listings, and market trends for your specific neighbourhood. In many cases, they'll want to see the property in person or at minimum review photos, because condition and upgrades can't be assessed from data alone. You then receive a detailed report showing what your home would likely sell for in the current market, along with context about how they arrived at that number.

A good CMA won't just give you a single price. It will provide a range with a low, midpoint, and high estimate, and explain the reasoning behind each. It will show you the comparable sales used, the adjustments made, and any market factors that could influence your price.

Why would an agent do this for free? Because it's how relationships start. Even if you're not selling for another two years, understanding your home's value helps you plan.

There are a few things to keep in mind. Some agents will inflate their CMA to win your listing, telling you what you want to hear rather than what the market will support. A trustworthy agent gives you an honest number backed by data, even if it's lower than you hoped. The last thing you want is to list at an unrealistic price, sit on the market for 90 days, and then reduce. That pattern erodes your negotiating position and often results in selling for less than if you'd priced correctly from the start.

## What's Changed in the Kelowna Market That Affects Your Home's Worth

If you bought your home during the pandemic-era frenzy of 2021 or early 2022, your **home value in Kelowna** may look different than you expect. The market has recalibrated since those peak days, and understanding where things stand now is essential.

Total residential sales in the Central Okanagan for 2025 came in at 3,640 units, made up of 1,945 single-family homes, 648 townhouses, and 1,047 condominiums. Active listings have been elevated, with inventory levels well above the 10-year average. Average days on market have stretched to around 66 to 77 days depending on the property type and month, compared to the frenetic pace of 2021 when homes were selling in days with multiple offers.

The benchmark price for a single-family home, while still above the $1 million mark, is down roughly 7.5% from the April 2022 peak. Townhomes have seen a steeper correction, dropping about 18.5% from their record high. Condos are down approximately 15.6% from peak levels. These are significant shifts, particularly for homeowners who bought near the top.

But context matters. If you purchased your home before 2020, you've still seen substantial appreciation. Even with the correction, Kelowna prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels. And with the Bank of Canada having lowered rates through 2024 and into 2025, borrowing costs have come down, which typically supports demand over time.

The 2025 market was characterized by a standoff: sellers weren't willing to bring prices down to where buyers would accept, and buyers weren't willing to pay what sellers were asking. The homes that sold quickly were those priced realistically by motivated sellers.

Looking ahead, many forecasters expect the Kelowna market to stabilize further in 2026, with modest price growth in the range of 1% to 3% as inventory normalizes and rates settle. If you're thinking about selling, getting an accurate **Kelowna home valuation** now will help you decide whether the timing is right or whether holding makes more sense.`,
