- Dark, rich color palette: deep charcoal, black, navy as foundation
- Warm gold/champagne accents
- Clean white space for breathing room
- Large, full-bleed hero imagery and video
- Professional photography of Karsen in Kelowna settings (not stock photos)

## Typography

- **Headlines:** Cormorant Garamond (refined serif with luxury editorial feel)
- **Body text:** Inter (clean sans-serif, highly readable)
- Generous letter-spacing on labels and navigation
- Type should feel high-end without being unreadable

## Motion & Interaction

- Smooth scroll animations (framer-motion)
- Elements fade in as you scroll
- Parallax on hero imagery
- Rotating/cycling text on homepage
- Hover effects on listing cards and navigation
- Video background in hero (like Jade Mills / Carolwood)
- Site should feel alive without being overwhelming or slow

## Photography Direction

- Professional photos of Karsen in real settings
- Drone shots of Kelowna for hero backgrounds
- Interior shots of luxury listings
- Imagery should sell the lifestyle, not just the house
