# The Vision

This website is the digital headquarters for Karsen Koltun. Real estate is the lead. Everything else lives under the same roof but doesn't compete for attention.

The goal is not to look like a brokerage template. The goal is to look like a brand.

## Core Principles

1. **Real estate first.** Homepage and primary navigation prioritize buying, selling, and searching homes in Kelowna.
2. **Personal brand second.** The site should feel like Karsen, not Royal LePage. The brokerage is mentioned where required, but the brand is Karsen Koltun.
3. **Lead capture everywhere.** Every page has a purpose and a form. Every form feeds into GoHighLevel with proper tagging and pipeline routing.
4. **Modern and cinematic.** Dark tones, warm accents, high-quality photography, video backgrounds, smooth animations. Inspired by Jade Mills, Carolwood Estates, Dan Martell, AJ Hazzi.
5. **Scalable.** The architecture supports adding new landing pages, blog posts, ventures, and features over time without restructuring.
